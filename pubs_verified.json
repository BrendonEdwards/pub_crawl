From the gigs, to bar billiards, to a pleasant garden, and display of local art you'll be immersed in a pub that feels modern, relevant while taking the best aspects of the traditional pub and its heritage along with it. Loads of amenities and events go on here and the place has a simple lived-in feel that locals seem to love. While difficult to go over the top about, it is notable precisely because of how few of these places there are now. Well off the tourist drag despite being relatively central. (added 2019)",

Then take into account the lack of money and good taste, and there isn’t often much left by way of a friendly, locals pub.<br>However, thankfully there are exceptions, one of those being Black Dog in Mostar, which is located a short walk over the old bridge. When the restaurants draw to a close around 10:30pm head here for your onward socialising, with a cast of regulars who speak English and will greet and talk to you. Although I imagine they meet English people fairly regularly given Mostar’s reputation and position on the tourist trail, they seemed pretty keen on making our acquaintance. The bar guy is typically steady and impassive, and the pub itselfa wooden cabin-style interior, almost in the manner of a western saloon. <br>Although they offer a range of beers, the beer choice appears to be yet another dividing line, so although Sarajevsko might be the best beer on offer, have a good look to check the local options. Mostar has a brewery so at the very least a first glass of their beer will be taken as polite.<br>Being such an informal place, I got the picture this place remains open until the last person leaves, but similarly might not even bother staying open past 9:30pm if it seems quiet. Make your presence known, ingratiate yourself with a few local characters and enjoy both the inside and the terrace area which still has a beautiful view of Mostar’s old town area.<br>",

Why then does it have an appearance on this list?<br>Well, once you’ve taken everything about the pub as a whole, there’s actually rather a lot to like. The interior itself is like stepping into a country barn, rather impressive considering you’re in Barcelona city centre. No windows, but plenty of space, with side rooms and a large central area with a raised seating area and a large area in front of the bar for standing/games etc.<br>Although the décor looks like it gets a hammering week in week out, the rustic furniture is sturdy and built to last, the general feel is pretty warm and welcoming. The dark wooden ceiling, vaulted beams, stone walls and huge chimney really help build a characterful interior. The side rooms themselves have some interesting features such as intricate rustic tiling. The space itself gives you a breathing space (should you require it) from the excitable and sometimes a little too in-your-face student crowd. <br>Further plus points for the facilities, with a pool table, dart board, jukebox, along with a few community events they have going on. The decision to place the pool table by the bar area is ridiculously stupid though, meaning the players can’t play their shots without jabbing cues into people.<br>The beer isn’t the best selection you’ll ever be met with, however the prices are very good and adequately compensate. <br>The place transforms depending on the time of day, so afternoon and early evenings may seem rather sedate (and definitely the best time for a game of pool) but the late opening hours mean it turns into one of those boisterous venues that you can leave in the early hours and find it was as busy, if not busier than when you came in.<br>I wouldn’t recommend it for a romantic soiree, exactly, and they could easily attract the same audience without the marketing being so garish and out of place. The beer selection is a little poor as well, so there is work to do. The fundamentals are there though, this is a genuine pub with a good atmosphere.",

There are plenty of similar bars in England, most of which are as dirty, ragged and out of date as the musicians are themselves.<br>However, I always have a morbid fascination with how other countries interpret British culture and the combination of being able to do that over a beer, along with it being in a convenient location at that point in the evening, made it worth a try.<br>Manchester is based down the warren of narrow back streets in Barcelona’s attractive and rather atmospheric Gothic Quarter. In the past locating it might have presented a challenge but anyone with gps should find it with ease.<br>The sign sticks out on your entry to the tiny square, and on entry step down to the bar area and you’ll find a fairly small and lively space, decorated in the fashion a lot of bars thought was cool back in the late 90s and early 2000s, which now seems oddly quaint.<br>The bar largely serves cheap beer and cheap cocktails, although on our visit nearly everyone was drinking Heineken as it was on sale for 1 euro 50 cents. Being on holiday, we naturally didn’t see the need to take such drastic measures. There are some decent bottles including imported German beer and the standard Barca lagers on tap, all of which are cheap themselves.<br>Naturally, the music is pretty good, though don’t expect it to be all strictly Mancunian, they were playing a range of British indie, punk and psych music from the 70s all the way up to the mid 00s.<br>The general atmosphere is good because its inhabited by a mainly local crowd, and manages to be busy and vibrant while still having available seating.<br>There’s no point going over the top about it. Manchester certainly isn’t doing anything unique or brilliant, but it’s a good option for a cheap beer or cocktail and a hang out, to enjoy some music and be on your way.<br>A: 7/10 B: 6/10 C: 8/10 D: 7/10 E: 8/10 F: 8/10",

Well, I’ll start in reality TV style by shattering your illusions and then build a new impression from scratch.<br>The pipe stuff was so low key as to be virtually non-existent. I didn’t mind that so much but was rather surprised. The description of the décor may have previously applied, but again didn’t fit my expectation.<br> <br>There are a number of different rooms, as this place is set in a first floor apartment in Placa Reial. It’s an atmospheric venue as it clearly used to be a rather grand apartment. Enormous ceilings and grand doorways, while the bar makes use of its prime location with some extraordinarily good views over the square. You can dip in and out of the various features, which are, in turn, quite interesting.<br><br>There’s a fairly trad modern bar area just in front of the entrance that serves upscale cocktails and a couple of dull beers on tap, San Miguel Selecta being the best. This seems to have been renovated as the images online suggest a working man’s club type bar area was previously there. There’s a room showing some vintage cinema, and another room with a pool table of all things.<br> <br>I have to mark it down for the general sense of confusion – it certainly failed to fit some of the descriptions, though there is reference to a private member’s lounge, there’s not much point referencing that unless you can access it.<br>Definitely pay a visit and see if you can get more from it that we did. Even if you don’t there’s a very pleasant stylish apartment bar with good cocktails and great views. <br>",

It does have an English name, and plenty of English language stuff about (a relief in a city where all the signs are in Cyrillic) but the venue is focused on the idea of a pub itself, and there are some detailed, understated touches in the decor which help create a strongly recognisable pub atmosphere. <br>It’s worth stating at this point there are a number of Black Turtles around the city, five I believe, only one of which I have been to, located near Kalmegdan fortress. However, research concludes the template is more or less the same in each venue, so I feel safe in writing this in the knowledge that a great deal will apply to the whole chain.<br>Along with being a reliable spot for good quality beers, the other draw to visit is the very lively atmosphere. There are many backpackers who drop down here, as there are young Serbians who want something to drink that isn’t the ubiquitous and awful Jelen Piwo. I remember the experience being a loud, occasionally raucous and smokey experience which is more or less what you would want and expect from Belgrade in general.<br>Being far away from home, it is wise to give some places a degree of latitude in certain areas they fall short – primarily because there often aren’t superior options. So visit The Black Turtle (any of the black turtles) with your eyes open, as it is no drinking mecca akin to Prague, Krakow or Brussels’ pubs, but it is still pretty damn good.<br>A: 8/10 B: 7/10 C: 9/10 D: 7/10 E: 7/10 F: 8/10",

They have now trademarked the ‘Gostilna Slovenija’ in their ongoing attempt to promote and rationalise what is a distinct and important offering in an otherwise dinky and Slavic-influenced country.<br>The Gostilna is the nearest place you can think of to an English country inn, a large but very homely venue, predominantly serving food but also offering pub elements. Originally these began through landlords inviting guests around to taste their local food and wine. In the countryside these venues offer a home away from home, roaring fires, hearty food and shelter from harsh weather.<br>As a small town in the foothills of the Julian Alps, Bled is well placed to offer a good Gostilna, and there are a few worthy venues in town. The greatest of all is Gostilna Pri Planincu, both a cracking country restaurant of true history and authenticity, and a characterful local pub.<br>The service was efficient, ruthlessly polite and cheerful, and the food as you could expect arrived in suitably mountainous portions, after a reassurringly long wait. Our whole table were in approval at the size and the flavour of the food. Dining occurs in evocative country surroundings that feel real and aged with time and use rather than occasionally kitsch and plastic. Little oddities such as the stuffed witch character hanging from the ceiling are precisely the sort of oddity you wouldn’t find in a bar created from scratch.<br>Slovenia’s drinks options are still limited at the time of writing but Lasko is a bearable lager for the first pint. The pub area is typically countrified and has an obsession with car registration plates that cover more of the walls and ceilings than you’d first expect.<br>On a trip out into the countryside it would be difficult to create a venue more desirable to visit than this excellent Gostilna. The only improvements I can think of would be longer opening hours for the bar area and a physical extension to the pub area, which would elevate this to a 10/10.",

There are inset blackboards with the beer options and specials, while the staff run a very slick operation. <br>I originally thought that was it, but there are further rooms with pillars, arches and an enormous curved ceiling. Despite all this grandeur, it doesn’t feel particularly traditional. Everything is new and there is a conspicuous absence of history and character to the place. However, they are consciously at the start of that journey, and the fixtures and fittings themselves are clearly built to last.<br>The beer then, an unfiltered 12 degrees lager is heavenly, the dark lager itself as fresh and flavourful as you could reasonably expect. You’d knock back a few no problems at all. Bar service allows for that to happen with alacrity. 2 euros for a large glass constitutes good value across Europe in general, although represents something like a 75% markup on similarly good beers you can access locally.<br>Even if you just wanted lunch Mestiansky won’t disappoint. There are a range of central European staples, but the ingredients are noticeably fresh, carefully cooked and have a little extra flourish that elevates the dishes. <br>It’s difficult to determine local life in this place. They haven’t made anywhere near enough provision for a dedicated drinking area which deserves a big mark down, but I did notice quite a few solo males who drop in for a drink or for lunch. At night I still feel the place would lean more towards dining than drinking. <br>It’s a shame as only a few different decisions could have helped the place feel inclusive for dedicated drinking and dining, but it’s unlikely they’ll be able to change this template without practically ripping up half the area.<br>Therefore, drop by for a drink and for lunch, or go to the bar on an evening to sample their fantastic beers, for the pure enjoyment, and feel a little wistful and regretful that they passed up the opportunity to make something better",

Backing this philosophy up is absolutely excellent, world class beer kept to strict and exacting standards that is so singularly enjoyable you can find yourself in many scuzzy and otherwise unappealling dive bars still with something to literally cling on to.<br>This Bernard insignia pub typifies working class drinking, set with only a car park between it and the dual carriageway out of town. It’s easy to reach if you’re near the old town, 15 minutes walk, or 10 minutes if you’re based on the road up to the castle. The discount supermarket and sex shop next door certainly hammers home the location even further, yet there is a terrace area outside with some pleasant bench seating. <br>The real welcome is the blackboard stand by the pub, boasting of nearly the full Bernard range from the simple desitka at barely a euro for a glass up to the bock type special beers. Walk inside and find a very simple cosy room with a dinky bar area. There is a TV in the corner and some ice hockey memorabilia dotted around the place. Don’t expect anything fancy otherwise, it’s a classic sporty local drinking hole. The staff don’t speak English but neither do they utter any objection or hostility when you order a beer – they know why you are here and are pleased to serve. The other patrons inside barely even turn around to acknowledge you in their haze of cigarette smoke and drunkenness, which might give you peace of mind if you sometimes dislike feeling like an intruder.<br>The terrace is a bit more communal, and even if you aren’t involved in conversation there is a friendly feel to sit with the crowd. The pub crowd is an odd split between young couples who sit outside and typically grizzled old boozehounds who wander in and out, but this sort of works in its favour and I quite like places like this that throw different groups of people together.<br>The Bernard is excellent, disappearring down the hatch with alarming ease. On both occasions I found myself dispatching several in short order, the combination of price and quality proving irresistible. While there are many humdrum aspects to the pub you could probably find in dozens of other hospodas in the city, I couldn’t think of a better example of a comfortable, strongly-supported diverse working class venue, and the beer and value just tops it off. <br>When compared to the central brewery and pub Mestiansky Pivovar with its glass, chrome and corporate feel, Bernard pri Lyceu provides a stark contrast but equally, a welcome reminder of the more homely and simple values of pub going.",

This is enhanced further by the gorgeous copper mash tuns by the kitchen which give evidence of the brewing activity at the hotel. There is a nice range of beer ephemera and artwork spaced out sparsely along the walls, and there is the potential that adding more and making it a little more ramshackle would give it more character and the feel of it being an institution.<br><br>Often these efforts can end up being an afterthought and a little corporate/by-the-numbers, but Pegas have concocted a solid, high quality range of Czech beers supplemented by seasonal brews. When combined with the friendly beer hall atmosphere it justifies wandering in for a drink alone.<br><br>Food is decent - big portions of hearty winter fuel cooked with fresh ingredients, well seasoned and delicious, although increasingly quite expensive.<br><br>Service is professional and courteous, relatively tourist-friendly, although you may get ushered towards the corner of your table when a big group arrives, that is rather inevitable. There is a lunch crowd and an evening crowd, so if you don’t want to mingle your boozing in with dining try mid-afternoon, early evening or late night.<br><br>As hinted at above, Pegas is actually in its infancy, but all its moves so far have been the right ones.

Narrow entrance leads to a wider backroom. Plenty of wood but not really a 'Belgian cafe'. Bras on the ceiling in dive bar fashion.<br>Atmosphere/Character: Suitable for an afternoon or evening, although the tempo certainly rises later on. A mixed crowd, albeit largely tourists.<br>Amenities/Events: Some seasonal events, rotating drinks offers, space in the backroom for board games, etc.<br>Value For Money: Typical for central Bruges, ie. Not Cheap.<br>description: The venue has quickly acquired the sort of memorabilia, gifts and tat that accompany bars of far greater age. It took me aback a little as their website and some of the descriptions had made it seem like quite a modern, sterile (if interesting) specialist beer tasting house.<br>The core purpose of the bar is to serve eight small-batch tapped Belgian ales on rotation, be that seasonal or chance offerings. These are outlined in an ever changing clipbook you will no doubt be handed upon your seating at the bar. <br>Disappointingly, Bieratelier’s own house beer is a thin, unworthy and wholly disappointing blonde, but at the time of visiting, the other beers were all of a dark xmas ale style, with the exception of a gorgeous strong ale from Dupont Avec Bons Voeux, nevertheless brewed seasonally for the holidays. <br>Despite being a degustation for beer, the bar lady is teetotal and not Belgian. In spite of the fact she is very friendly, conversational and a natural in all other ways the job demands, she has little to say about the beers, indeed she has a well-rehearsed bit about being ‘perfect for the role’, so be warned if you’re making a beer pilgrimage solo, despite the beer tasting purpose, the bar chat is not going to be beer based past the bleeding obvious.<br>The bar area is in the front room, which has a row of 8-9 seats. There is a very decent pub area in the back room as well, but the front seats feel like the important ‘service seats’, and it was engaging to sit there with a few other couples all working their way through the enormously strong array of xmas ales.<br>Prices are on the high side, but similarly generosity and loyalty is rewarded. We all received Gordon Xmas Ale branded socks, St. Bernadus playing cards, a La Chouffe bauble, and a number of freebie tastings before our purchases. The pleasure of company, good conversation and the psychological effect of being handed freebies soon made the slight shock to the wallet dissipate.<br>It’s good that the bar has made a concerted effort to do something different without snubbing the needs of most bar goers, and it’s in a nice area of town, just enough off a side-street so as to be quiet on an afternoon. The atmosphere is decent without being electric, and there are (as usual) a few rooms for improvement. Ditch the house beer for a start, it’s poor. A bartender with background knowledge of the beers, slightly fairer pricing, and a few bits here and there to improve the character and the seating would attract more locals and all elevate the experience.<br>As it is, Bieratelier is a very good option to taste a new Belgian beer, a friendly and homely spot that’s more down to earth than you’d expect from the website or the concept of the bar and importantly definitely a full fledged pub and bar rather than a café. A good option in a city with lots of good options and a few genuinely great options – i.e – go if it fits in with your pub crawl or preferences, but you may not feel like you’ve missed out on a star attraction if you don’t.<br>A: 9/10 B: 7/10 C: 7/10 D: 7/10 E: 5/10 F: 8/10",

While still romantic there is a slightly foreboding gothic quality at work, in an understated fashion.<br>Otherwise, you have a quite typical Belgian pub, a smallish space, one room with with stocky and comfy bench seating and thick wooden tables starting from by the window to the back wall opposite the bar. The bar area gleams with the most impressively clean and varied selection of glasses hanging above the bar. It’s a miracle they manage not to smash dozens of these a week, but the slow, measured service gives an indication that nothing here is done in a rush, indeed nothing needs smashing when you’re delivering the beers with the sort of care and attention normally preserved for new born babies.<br>The pub aims at an affluent market, meaning the base price for a bottle is 4 euros 50 and upwards. I’m torn as to whether that is worth it, as the quality of the beer is great, as is the atmosphere of the pub, but similarly, you can find great beer virtually anywhere, and Bruges is not a city lacking in atmospheric venues to drink beer. The other consequence of the price is that it drives out locals, apart from wealthy couples, from seeking it out. It is far from the worse venue in Bruges for this, and the theme and style of the bar probably makes it more forgivable that there isn’t a clutch of men in their 70s sat at the bar clutching glasses of Jupiler and grunting.<br>As a couple, you need to pay a visit to Café Rose Red. As a solo traveller it is an intense sensation but perhaps inessential and fairly lonely feeling choice. As a group, it works well as a pub venue, although any sort of raucousness and raised voices doesn’t quite fit with the tone of the place. Nevertheless it comes recommended and definitely in the top ten drinking holes in Bruges.",

Set just 10 minutes walk from the central square, Vintage offers a far more gritty experience, while still maintaining a few norms you could expect from a typical Belgian pub.<br>Vintage is a hangout for rock music fans and has attached biker clubs, along with the odd bit of football represented. Thankfully this is one pub that hasn’t been cleansed of local life, and despite being halfway between the station terminal and the centre of the old town, and looking innocuous enough from the outside it seems to keep tourists at bay. No doubt the pugnacious feel of the place has something to do with that - which isn’t to say it’s all rough and ready, as there is a roaring fire and a cosy intimate feel, but they seem determined to project the fact Bruges isn’t all twee, chocolates and lace - it has some teeth.<br>Drinking mainly occurs on stool seating rather than chairs, for me usually indicating a venue to be more of a late night stand up bar where they need the floor space, but it is a little bit lacking comfort for afternoon drinking. At night though, and also in the early evening for a quick drink. Vintage is a great choice to sup Belgian ale, which it does a reasonable selection of at moderate prices. It could be improved by stocking the local Fort Lapin or Damme’s beer but that is nitpicking.<br>The unpretensiousness was summed up for me in the beer pouring. Often drinking a Belgian ale in England is defined by this ludicrous ceremony as though they are attempting to forge jewellery from precious metals, but instead of this nonsense the bar guy will take your expensive quadrupel, slam the liquid into its component glass (somehow managing to get the head on it just right) and bin the bottle without a by or leave. If you’d rather read the label, then be prepared to let them know in advance (they won’t mind overly).<br>A terrific counterpoint to the great but admittedly stuffier establishments in the centre of Bruges, this is where to go if you want to hang out with a few locals, drink a great beer in a down to earth environment and listen to some decent music; what pub going is all about in many ways.",

However, there is also a formality to the place. The staff all wear rather old-fashioned tabards in the manner of milksops, and look particularly strange given they are both bald. The seating is all stiffly upright in the manner of a restaurant despite the place only serving bar snacks and very basic meals, and there is only table service rather than bar service. <br>This style sets it apart from other Belgian venues and is nearer to a Brauhaus in format. At the same time I can’t help but feel it would be even better and possibly loveable with a slight rejig of the pub seating, more communal tables and upholstered seats, losing the traditional tabards without this affecting any of what the pub does best.<br>The pub serves blends of Lambic from the barrel, something you will struggle to find anywhere. The standard blend Lambic doux, is a really beautiful blend of sweet and ever so slightly sour beer. Similarly, they do blends of Gueue and Kriek which are worth a try. These are served in a ceramic jug which you then dispense into small beakers. This gives the impression of drinking more than perhaps you actually have, which is good because A La Becasse isn’t the cheapest venue in Brussels.<br>There is a decent range of beer covering most of the usual Belgian styles from good breweries, meaning you can happily sit around and enjoy a quality beer in some impressively stately surroundings. <br>This is one of the few really central pubs where I felt there was an array of local regulars, mainly middle aged folk who would turn up for a jug of Lambic and a spread of cheese and pickles. The place also sees custom from adventurous couples seeking a secluded drink down the rabbit hole and away from the crowds. <br>It can take a while to get busy, even given the central location, but when busy A La Becasse transforms into a genuinely heartwarming lively, social and characterful venue, though you do need it to be at least three-quarters full in order to foster that great communal hubbub. Perhaps a few changes to the format, without throwing the baby out with the bathwater could ensure that",

It might count as a brown café for the bench seating up the sides of the long room, if it wasn’t for the lack of brown elsewhere and the elegant ornamental décor stacked with crenullations, and stately design. You have a venue somewhere in between a café and a salon, originally built as a place for socialites to be seen in, and still focused predominantly on beer. It is so of its time it’s difficult to think of too many other places that are alike.<br>Mort Subite is the draft beer, and this brewery serves fruit beers and lambic effect rather than the real McCoy. They are still rich in flavour and sweetness, and a tad sour, but lacking any sort of dryness and depth that might indicate the traditional lambic brewing process. A small serving of their kriek for example, which would be a good choice, will set you back five euros on its own. Some of the other options are fairly astronomical considering the price one can drink for elsewhere, and in excellent surroundings.<br>They clearly feel they are unique, and annoyingly, they are right. An afternoon drink in A La Mort Subite can feel rather like a drink in a café, albeit a particularly impressive historical one, but not so bar like. The place starts to come alive in the evening time as the crowd changes, and you can suddenly start to absorb some of the atmosphere and understand the underlying reasons for the endurance of this place. The grandeur and glamour of socialising in the pre-war era is yet to be recreated around Europe on any identifiable level, partly because of the lack of venues who have committed to investing the kind of money to pull it off well, and also because the eventual crowd it attracts tend to have little to no appreciation of their surroundings anyway. They visit for novelty factor alone. <br>A La Mort Subite is a preserved remnant of a particular era and a great opportunity for anyone with a real passion in the rich and diverse history of socialising, beer drinking and recreational culture to soak in something different.<br>Service is almost classically continental, with wide stomached balding Rene type characters smoothly dissecting the venue with assurance and steady hands under the drinks trays. They are immaculately professional and patient considering the table service and conveyor belt of foreign tourists. <br>Although the evening and night crowd appeals to a few nostalgic locals, it’s usually Brussels tourists who venture in, and because of the heritage of the place, often a middle-aged crowd. <br>Changing the venue in anyway seems to be verboten, and I wouldn’t approve either however it seems to me there is nothing to stop it rejigging the drinks choices and doing some marketing from the outside, as this venue is not designed for middle aged obese American sat in Burghaus jackets, it is designed for the young, the stylish and the vibrant. The way to really bring back the good old days isn’t just to leave the décor and service meticulously unchanged and hope for the best. The good old days were good because they were vital, vibrant and inhabited a nascent social scene.<br>In order for A La Mort Subite to take the next step, they need to be brave enough to recapture the zeitgeist in any way that doesn’t upset the period features, rather than settling for being a museum.",

This is backed up with a live roster, usually set up in the backroom, which overall lift the venue from interesting and pointedly dingy gothic cellar to a truly enjoyable offbeat destination that’s quite a bit different from other places you can visit in the vicinity.<br><br>Bring a group so you’re adding to the atmosphere.

Then, if you walk around the corner you will find what looks like a perfectly normal lively Belgian pub – wooden tables, beer ephemera on the walls and some laid back seating, certainly not in any way geared up for a wild party.<br>The third area, the basement constantly morphs with the crowd. The atmosphere can change in fifteen minutes from a jovial hubbub in a traditional beer hall type atmosphere to party central, and half an hour snap back again. The décor down there is also traditonal and you will see barrel ends everywhere and beer ephemera stretching back through the ages.<br>There is the regular Delerium bar menu, but don’t go off that, ask for the beer bible. Delerium was known at one point for offering the most beers in the world for any bar, and a flick through the book would seem to confirm that. Impressively, the vast majority from the hundreds on offer are Belgian, but they have dipped their toe across the globe as well should you fancy anything from Zambia or Barbados (unlikely). Be patient for some of these as they will require staff to dive downstairs for the relevant bottle and hunt around for the glass. <br>As you’d expect, the pub is a mecca for Americans and tourist from the Far East, likewise English and Australian backpackers, though I have seen a tonne of Spanish and Italian people here as well. Don’t expect to brush shoulders with the Bruxelloise or indeed any Belgians other than those with slightly tired expressions acting as the chaperones of excited young women they are with.<br>I have had some average experiences in Delerium, not awful exactly but a bit loud, towny and unloveable, and similarly a couple of terrific nights where I’ve got talking to a group. It can transform after a few drinks and with the right people into a really good venue. <br>Some of the areas are getting a bit dog eared purely because of the volumes of people coming and going. It gets more wear and tear than most, so in a few years time I think they will need to give it a bit of a revamp. The decorations still look okay but the furniture, the bar area and some of the literature is due a refresh.<br>It almost goes without saying that a visit to Brussels will include a drink in Delerium at some point. In order to get the best out of it, think about how many people you’re with, how social you’re feeling and what time of day it is. When you’re already drunk, in a good mood and feeling like you want to chat to folk it provides an excellent opportunity to socialise and have fun.<br>Also, don’t race up and down the courtyard on your way in and out, hang around for a while to take in the vibrant atmosphere and look towards the far end for a particularly amusing take on the Mannekin Pis, a female version called Jeanneke. <br>You might also want to pop across the courtyard to Floris, Delerium’s sister bar, though this place isn’t focused on beer and there’s not quite as much of interest.",

You can read numerous gushing reviews about this place, and it is admittedly a wonderful pub in many ways.<br>The impasse itself is another itch-scratching curiosity, this time well signposted with an ornate stone entrance that is difficult to miss, with a number of neon signs from classic Belgian brands and at the other end of the alley a quirky medieval style sign over the front door beckoning people inside. Yes please.<br>You will note the stained glass windows from the outside and once in you are greeted by a cosy pub with some unique features and gothic décor that go beyond the level of detail usually associated with humble taverns. Try and visit out of the Christmas season as their decorations are hideous and ruin the otherwise fantastic feel of the place.<br>Unlike the hard exposed wooden benches of most Brussels pubs you can expect comfy upholstered and cushioned seats, angled corners like an English pub, and a true feeling of security and cosiness that’s difficult to create from scratch.<br>One of the niggling problems that has always restrained me from taking up a short term leasehold tenancy agreement in the place is the price, which similar to A La Mort Subite is a ripoff. The selection is also quite poor by Belgian standards, although you can expect the typical trappiste offerings marked up by 25%. This poor pricing has desolated the place of nearly all locals or regulars, something a pub like this would greatly benefit from. It’s a great shame, as without locals it doesn’t extend beyond being a frozen in time museum piece hollowed out for the novelty of tourists, when it could be far far more than that.<br>Nonetheless, it’s impossible not to pay a visit because the pub is unique, carrying a feel unlike nearly any other Brussels pub going. Visit and like me you will take a moment to contemplate just how incredible it would be if it was run by locals for locals, to its full potential.",

It’s nice to have a good spread of places to go to, even in a smaller city, as there are usually unforeseeable elements such as the pub being closed or deserted, or just unpleasant. Given the few options available it appearred essential to note down. It appeared to have an adjoining pub section, which, while not ideal on the face of it, was better than nothing.<br>Fortunately, this pub is quite separate from the hostel, indeed the first steps walking through the door make it seem uncertain this is actually a hostel. With a sloping wooden floor down to an old fashioned bar area, traditional Czech bench seating lined along the walls and a classic Pivnice style curved roof, there is in essence a self-contained pub in the front room.<br>The bar staff are also a bit more hospitable on account of the adjoining hostel, and there are a couple of the very decent Eggenberg beers brewed literally just down the road. These are served in classic Czech glasses – thick, sturdy with a wide brimmed base and a handle. Prices are under a pound a pint, so overall, some pretty glorious drinking is to be had.<br>The patrons are for the most part all connected to the hostel, though I saw enough people venturing in from the outside. There is a clear hostel sign above the door which no doubt puts a few people off, but I reiterate – this is a full on Czech pub, and I’m not sure what else it would need to do in order to quality.<br>On your trip to the toilet you will notice there are some back rooms with overspill seating which are not quite in the same Pivnice style but were also busy and the sound of conversation was feeding through to the main room, helping create a nice atmosphere.<br>The middle of the main room is kept clear, presumably to accommodate large groups arriving with luggage, but I think it would help if there was a central table, and it wouldn’t make entrance overly difficult. Similarly, I wouldn’t want to stop at a hostel with a pub in case my room was above/underneath and I wanted some sleep. But that’s hostel reviewing, not pub reviewing, and this is in most ways a really good old fashioned pub, with some characterful elements and that quirky sloped floor especially underlined the rather gnarled medieval feel of Cesky Krumlov’s bars and cellars.",

The venue is vast set among three floors, and containing backrooms that will make you feel like you’re in down in a cellar even when you’re reclining thirty feet in the air.<br>Service in a Kolsch brauhaus starts by taking a table, and barely after sitting down a gruff Kobe will have greeted you to check whether you want anything else except a conveyor belt of Kolsch. Give a quick nod or indication it’s beer you’re after, and you’re pretty much all set until it’s time to settle up.<br>The Kobes who serve the Kolsch are renowned for being notoriously stuff which is amusing given they probably have the most contact with the general public of any bar/restaurant staff. The reason for this is that the Kolsch is served in 0.2l, partly for the purpose of never having to drink the ‘dregs’ from a glass. The beer is always delivered lightning quick in the hope that your speed of drinking will be likewise.<br>As a result, the venue demands dozens of Kobes on their feet all day rushing around with circular pods rather than trays, each with space for 20 or so glasses of Fruh. If you’re anywhere near the end of your glass a replacement will be on its way before you can even stop them – indeed the only way to do so is to pop the beer mat on your glass, whereby they will tot up the pencil marks they’ve been inscribing on there and charge you accordingly.<br>The serving measure is one way of making quite a lot of money, and to be honest it’s pretty easy to drop 10-15 euro in here on drinks without even paying much attention. The beer is a crystal clear ale (not strictly speaking a lager) with a well balanced pils-like balance between sweetish flavour and bitter refreshing aftertaste. It’s sometimes easy to overlook Kolsch which on a good day stands up to anything.<br>Fruh is the face of Kolsch worldwide and you may have drank some of their pasteurised stuff from bottles, which are generally quite poor representations of drinking Kolsch in Cologne which always seems to have a cleaner, less acrid taste than the pasteurising and bottling process seems to end up producing. <br>The space inside Fruh is designed to allow for dining, and to be honest this can detract from values I am hoping to judge, namely the pub-going quality. Some areas do not feel overly communal and much more restaurant-like. Another downside is they will kick you out on some days what seems rather early, and the service towards the end of the evening couldn’t be clearer that they want you to go home.<br>That said, the place is ideal for big groups, and does indeed have plenty of rooms for en masse socialising in true German fashion, and the offering of food still remains a net positive. <br>We all know you’re going to end up in this pub in Cologne so this is enough talk from me about it – get on with it!",

There are enormous medieval style candelabras with tiers of lamp lights attached (better that than wax dripping on your head), and several rooms and ante-rooms all of which are consistent with the theme, some of which look like they have hosted some grand municipal occasions. That sense of importance elevates the place from the get go.<br>Plenty of the Sion experience relies on the food, and while there are some mixed reviews about this, dining in Germany requires careful thought, as the wrong choice can often sit poorly with you afterwards. Our own experience was impressive, with a delicious seasoned wurst presented on a wooden block virtually the size of a snooker case. <br>The beer service is much like all the others, a time-honoured and efficient method of making you drink far more than you had ever intended to. The 0.2l glasses disappear in a few minutes flat and very soon they are replaced with another, and so on and so on, delaying the pain on your wallet until the end.<br>If Fruh is the modern epicentre of Kolsch in the known universe, and Peters is the understated, plucky purveyor of the ultimate Kolsch beer itself, Sion deserves a place in this trilogy for the historical atmosphere that more than the other two brings to life the heritage of pub going in central Cologne. <br>It’s a little bit more of a restaurant than a pub, but nevertheless qualifies and I submit this plea for you to visit and go drinking there on that basis.<br>",

It’s all communal, and surprisingly airy considering the traditional décor. There are some stylish windows lining the frontage and the place has an understated class about it, the piece de resistance being an impressive stained glass ceiling feature which is probably the takehome memory I have of the interior.<br>Service is a little less brusque than other places, probably a compliment to say they are unintrusive and get on with things without looking like the entire world is against them. Why the Kobes seem to act like English bus drivers is for a person better acquainted than I am to explain.<br>Don’t expect a particularly lively young crowd, as most of those people have gone to Fruh, or just not bothered with a traditional German brauhaus at all – they aren’t especially geared towards pure out and out night drinking after all, and Peters is no different, closing relatively early by the standards of a Kneipe or a club.<br>The Kolsch is crisp, clean, with a terrific refreshing flavour that speaks of the pure freshness. Cologne is a great example of a city where great tasting beer is available unpasteurised on site. The style may be the most uniform of all but it really does taste great. Peters beer is at standard price for the city centre and as usual served in the classic 0.2l Kolsch style glasses. Service isn’t as frenetic as Fruh as it doesn’t need to be, so you don’t feel like a Kobe is always on your shoulder, but likewise your glass will get replaced with another beer unless you put your beermat on top in quick order.<br>Peters Brauhaus should be an essential visit on your tour of Cologne’s Kolsch hauses, because it represents the near pinnacle of the beer style, and is a very charming and atmospheric venue.

Wall to wall red paint, this isn’t an understated theme by any means. Their idea seems to have been to fall somewhere in between groovy red-coloured bar with a dance area near the back and a more shady, boudoir type feel that is popular across Poland.<br>Somehow, falling squarely in-between, it works pretty well. <br>The front room has a small bar area which works as a good place to meet new people. The bar is close by to a few hostels and is on one of the main drinking drags in the city. The result is a healthy mixture of locals and curious travellers.<br>Beer-wise, don’t expect anything spectacular on tap, though this bar had a reputation for stocking local beers when all you could get were the big macro-brewed lagers and still does Browar Amber’s along with one or two others aside of the norm.<br>It’s really a social joint and a decent all-rounder pub with some extra points for the late-night party facilities, which while not everyone’s thing, provides a decent excuse to hang around from the transition between early evening conversation and late night revelry - opening hours which drag seemingly every remaining partygoer in the city here after 2am.

A tiny place set on a corner by one of the canal bridges, it could never have been purpose-built as a pub due to its uneconomically modest size. <br>A former fish stall, then tripe house, then schandstraffen, Galgenhuis has seen its fair share of fishy doings, none lessened by its conversion into a pub in the Victorian era. The main room fits a row of bench seats on each side of the room, and just enough space in the middle to congregate if they are full. The terrace area is probably bigger than the pub itself.<br>Galgenhuis counts as a genuine ‘brown café’ due to the traditional furnishings and genteel down to earth feel of the main room, very much a Belgian pub, but has some additional historical features that predate the style. It also has some impressive painted tiled walls and beamed ceiling painted with some rather threatening gallows-appropriate slogans. However, the white painted frontage sticks out a mile in front of some grand stepped gable buildings by the water front, and the modern signage, not really in keeping with the tradition or the interior, makes it look a little bland. <br>This isn’t a concern once you’re inside however, and if you’re lucky enough to find a seat you’ll want to stay for the duration. Perhaps it’s the modest size that makes it feel like the centre of the action, being so close to the water nearby and the goings-on in the street, it really does feel like being inside a capsule. The bar area is set a half-level down from the street, but with plenty of windows outside there is a slight chalet/grotto type feel.<br>If you strip back the numerous eccentricities there is a fundamentally sound pub. A cosy front room, jovial atmosphere, and during the evening that classic golden glow that emerges from a well decorated friendly pub room and careful application of beer.<br>Speaking of beer, there is a small but decent selection of Belgian ales on tap, from the fairly rare on tap Tongerlo down to a lager Primus, which is vaguely preferable to the ghastly Jupiler and a decent regular strength fallback if the dubbels, tripels and quadrupels are getting on top of you. <br>The bar staff carry out their job with pride, clearly feeling they are playing their small part in the continuation of Galgenhuis, and I felt they were among the more friendly in Ghent to the places I visited. <br>The central location means you can shoot off from here to half a dozen other bars and pubs within minutes, making it suitable for a pub crawl, but the high demand for seating makes this place the most suitable for a full afternoon session, so turn up early afternoon with a small group, bag a table and get drinking",

The Reinheitsgebot forbids beer brewed in Germany to stray beyond basic ingredients, and also to brew beer according to set standards.<br>This has proved both a blessing and a hindrance, because German beer has adopted immaculately high standards of brewing as a result, but similarly the styles of beer produced, with the exception of some zombified revivals like Sticke and Dampfbier haven’t beer as colourful or varied as the likes of Belgium or USA. This is changing, as in late 2015 Bavarian brewers voted in favour of a revision to allow other natural ingredients to be included in the roster, though this hasn’t resulted in any concrete revisions since.<br>In the meantime the limits German craft beer producers work within is much more rigid. Often these kind of restrictions can lead to inspiration and innovation, so there is a school of thought that their purity laws should be maintained for the sake of tradition. After all, the export market provides the different flavours and styles they wish to adopt in any event.<br>On the other hand, the parochialism and misguided sense of imperial superiority of the German beer drinker can be very annoying. Often their refusal to accept or even tolerate other beer styles makes me feel a strong dislike for them. On these occasions a trip to a craft beer venue like the wonderously inspired in-name Craft Bier Bar in Hannover is called for.<br>You all know the format by now. Unvarnished wood, industrial chic décor, multi-tap keg beer and a blackboard of ever changing beers. Plenty of high quality choice and different styles. <br>In terms of beer quality and friendliness you couldn’t hope to visit a nice place, particularly on a sunny afternoon with a set of tables on the terrace good for lingering around and supping beer of various styles. The bar guys are very talkative and passionate about what they’re doing. There isn’t yet the blaze and rather jaded supercilious that has developed in England.<br>It’s nonsensical that two very meritorious sorts of beers – traditional historical styles (when brewed to a good standard) and experiemental, but almost scientifically clinical and micro-managed craft ale would be pitted in competition with each other. For me they have little overlap and there is plenty of a market for them both. They should be concentrating on joining together to wipe crap chemical-tasting macro-brewed lager off the map. Instead Craft Beer appears to be about aggressively marketing to a young audience at the expense of the traditional crowd, deliberately setting itself against and positioning itself as separate from some brilliant and traditional breweries. There is little to no value in this.<br>Still, try telling any Craft Beer disciple this, I have even encountered some claiming to dislike ‘cask’ ale. It takes all sorts.<br>As per usual, Craft Bier Bar is not the kind of place to have a relaxing, cosy homely pub experience or a sit down. Apparently young people don’t want to be doing that. There’s a stripped back bare room and they just want people to be milling about, sharing their various beers for their unusual flavours. You would think both would be possible, but again, apparently Craft Beer must be distinct and separate, for reasons unknown.<br>I would still venture here as there’s little else to get overly excited about beer wise in Hannover, other than a corporate central brasserie with a bland venue but decent enough beer. There are some good Kneip’s around as well but Craft Bier Bar has a really excellent location next to the river in the Altstadt and a beautiful courtyard area where the restored and completely fake (but still authentic looking) fachwerk area is. Indeed Craft Bier Bar is set inside a fachwerkhaus, something which when you consider the interior proves to be a rather pointed juxtaposition.<br>As per usual, Craft Bier makes me feel very ambivalent, but when it comes to the products themselves there are some excellent beers to try. I remember drinking a wheat ale with just a tinge of ginger and apple flavour that was beautiful. You won’t find stuff like that in a traditional brauhaus, but then again, in this craft beer place you won’t find different generations of people enjoying good cheer among a setting redolent of the generations past. <br>Visit, and similar to myself experience the melange of differing emotions that generally accompanies craft ale drinking.<br>",

Karlovy Vary is a bit of a special case, as the stretch down the river is lacking any sort of late night drinking spot. The town is one of the oldest ‘resorts’ with its thermal springs making it a mecca for Russians and elderly Germans, and has much to recommend it in general, apart from the drinking scene.<br>Ordinary folk in Karlovy Vary live the other side of the river, or in effectively dormitory suburbs that are quite a way out of town, too far to realistically walk there and back if you’re based in the centre.<br>In order to get a beer that isn’t a crummy Krusovice for double the price in a drab restaurant or generic hotel bar, head up the hill on the south East bank where there are a few enclaves of local life, the best by far being California Club.<br>You still won’t be enamoured when you arrive, as the tacky American sign on the building and the energy drink sign outside still isn’t sending out any great signals. You can probably almost smell my desperation at this point as I dived inside.<br>However, when you enter you’ll find a bar teeming with local life and plenty of facilities making it worth hanging around for a drink. Pub games, live sport, and a large curved bar area serving a range of decent lagers, most importantly some pretty damn good Pilsner Urquell, cheaper than you’ll find in the centre of Prague for sure.The bar also serves as a ‘Herna’, a weird Eastern European thing where there is a partitioned gambling area based in the pub.<br>The décor is a little on the dated side, that isn’t all bad, as there are some nice cushioned lounge style seats which makes a nice change from the relentless hard bench seating of Czech Pivnices, but generally it’s nothing to write home about.<br>Ultimately it’s a chance to escape the centre, and will highlight just how hollowed out the centre of Karlovy Vary is, once the day trippers leave and the elderly hotel residents retire to bed. Thankfully there are places like this on the fringes where locals go, and although one might get a little sniffy at some of the stylistics, the beer is high quality, dirt cheap, it’s comfortable, warm and there’s lots to do. I wouldn’t usually have considered visiting a drinking hole called ‘California Club’, least of all solo in Eastern Europe, but the call of a beer is strong; necessity is the mother of invention.",

For a start, the simplicity but also it sets the expectation level for the one thing it does do, pretty highly.<br>This is Lithuania, and even more provincially than that, Kaunas, so there’s a silly bar name. Sorry about that, but don’t let it put you off just yet. At first glance at the name you might expect just some awful mid 00’s funky house bar with plastic seats and Corona bottles behind the bar. Thankfully this isn’t it at all.<br>Nisha is a pretty tiny corner bar, really like an updated 21st century version of an old fashioned French/Belgian drop in smoker’s bar where the working class man would pop over for a smoke and a beer. The update is to turn it into a smart, very compact but effective venue for local beer and quite a generous side helping of craft ale.<br>It is so intently beer focused that despite two of the four walls of the entire venue being the bar area, the remaining walls are stocked to the gills with various beers under the sun.<br>Talking with the owner, bizarrely they had formed a connection with Leeds Brewery and were serving Leeds Pale on tap. I thought about it for the novelty value, but after a quick reminder how awful Leeds Pale is even in Leeds, thought against it. Nevertheless, I humoured him and it was a nice exchange of opinions about the bar scene in our respective home cities. <br>I eventually settled on a Sour Pale Ale, in a craft style by a Vilnius based brewery which was delicious. The price was very reasonable for a craft beer, but in Lithuania it isn’t quite as cheap as you may think, so don’t be surprised to be paying 2 euros 50 cents upwards in a lot of mainstream venues just for one of their main lagers.<br>There isn’t much action going on in the afternoon, which shouldn’t have been surprising to me visiting on a shiveringly bleak November weekday, but you may find more joy in the evenings, as it is on a very doable pub crawl along some of Kaunas’ local bars. <br>The seating is mainly bar stools and the drinking mainly over ledges, so take a while to consider where Nisha fits into your drinking plans. Be assured though that it’s a high quality representation of Lithuania’s modern beer and bar scene, with many good beers to try and a willing participant in beer and bar chat if you’re flying solo.",

It must have been some heydey though, as during my visit it was rammed full of people who all looked like they were having a great time, also with that distinct feel that it was their regular hangout spot.<br>BO offers a range of the usual amenities in addition to the beer, board games, beer pong, foosball, rudimentary pub food, events nights etc, and is without doubt occupying itself with gathering a community around it as best as it can.<br>The furnishings and the bar concept is visibly getting past its sell by date but some how it doesn’t quite seem to matter. <br>As far as the beers go, you can fill your glass for a very decent price, and there are 6-7 decent taps with Lithuanian beer on offer, along with a correspondingly well stocked fridge full of bottles. It is, after consideration, a very good range and for the type of bar it is, good quality. Unfortunately you might find as with a lot of small time operations that the beer comes out very lively and they can take about three pint glasses to fill one glass full of beer. This can keep you waiting but thankfully the drink at the end is worth it.<br>BO remains a really good place to go if you want to start a conversation, as there are so many friendly groups, and similarly if you arrive and there’s a table free it’s a great place to spend an hour or two in Kaunas, both to socialise among yourselves and sample what the Kaunasii are up to with their free time.",

Despite CK Browar being young by most bars standards it already has somewhat of a heritage feel and a sentimental institution from another era. Only the 90s for crying out loud.<br>Not that it looks particularly impressive from the outside. It would be interesting to discover just how many people have been put off by the crappy formica sign above the door, and although it isn’t the bars fault, its commercial neighbours don’t exactly help to give off the vibe that this is the place to be.<br>Nevertheless, ignore all the frontage and wander downstairs where the appeal will become quickly apparent. A long main room adorned with some rather elegant old bar signs, and memorabilia, awards and ephemera from the bars early days as a mini-brewer.<br>The brewing happens behind the bar area, and if you take a look while walking through, the already sizeable cellar extends even further onwards to almost cavernous levels. You can buy five beers, all of which are the typical sort you can expect in central Europe, a light and dark lager, a wheat beer, a honey beer and a semi-dark style. They brew seasonable beers but usually only every 3-6 months. Most of the core range is very nice, particularly the unfiltered light lager, but the wheatbeer needs a complete revamp.<br>The seating is designed for large groups, and indeed for novelty value you can choose to buy beer by the 5 litre, which arrives in an enormous tube for your friends to tap-off at their leisure. It must be a pain to have to clean or something, as there is no discernible discount for choosing this option. <br>I’ve often found the service here a little slow, and lacking acknowledgement from the staff when you walk in. However, once the order is actually put in, beer and food arrives quickly. The food is pretty good, albeit a rather playing-it-safe array of dry meals to soak up the beer. It’s tasty enough and just as importantly won’t break the bank. Neither will the beers which are a perfectly fair price.<br>If you visit any time before 7-8pm it will feel more like a pivnice and restaurant but they are keen to ensure it carries out a pub venue, and have even extended a club area, which to me looks more like a greenhouse filled with disco smoke, but nevertheless some points for trying. The format is a delightfully honest attempt to create a central European beer cellar and due to some tasteful decisions and the largely successful beer offerings, I recommend a visit.",

Often older people have a tendency to criticise younger folk for being vacuous and only interested in glitz and edifice, citing the unsocial and artificial feeling clubs and towny bars some people prefer to visit. Omerta is one of many examples proving that, while they may follow trends like moth to a flame, superficiality is not in any way intrinsic to that. Far more important and intrinsic to most people is the social element of drinking.<br>Omerta is about sitting down and enjoying a beer in lively social company. There’s a silly and completely unnecessary ‘Godfather’ theme to Omerta, which is so low-key as to be virtually ignorable, but after that it’s very minimalistic. Cream walls, simple chairs and tables. Gather round, sink a few beers and chat with your friends.<br><br>Chiefly, what caused Omerta’s explosive popularity was the choice of beer, as they were a pub early on the craft scene in Poland, a scene in which Krakow was a big player in the early days. It’s debatable whether Omerta would have ever been such a social hub if it served only Tyskie, Zywiec, etc. Whoever made the decision to stock craft beer was jumping on an upward curve at just the right time.<br><br>While craft beer is starting to become mainstream in Poland it hasn’t reached the ubiquity of the UK by any means, with all the mediocrity and apathy that tends to engender. Similarly, the beer is competing with a fairly uniform beer style that frankly a lot of people are sick and tired of drinking day in day out.<br> <br>The main advantage of craft beer in Poland isn’t so much the beer itself. It’s great to have a range of choice brewed to a high standard, but with the exception of certain beers, they are generic and easy to find in the UK. What makes the high quality craft keg ale even better is paying little more than £2 at any one time for a pint of the stuff. It remains superb value, even if it is a big jump in price for the locals, on the evidence of any night out in Poland, they are prepared to pay it, often as they pay 15zl for a beer and a shot at the likes of Pijalnia Wodka I Pivo anyway.<br><br>Omerta offers a good range of craft beer from some breweries that are more or less local institutions already, and this is the place to come in Kazimierz for that. What’s interesting is that unlike the sheer pretentiousness of many craft ale bars, Poland’s general approach hasn’t gone that way at all, much more interested in keeping artifice to a minimum, and letting the beers speak for themselves. This must be applauded.<br><br>As with a lot of Kazimierz places, you’ll find that the locals haven’t given up on it just because some tourists have started going. Indeed it’s so busy and full of locals that I imagine a few travellers are probably put off going in at first. Time your visit well because standing around with a craft ale in this place isn’t ideal. Once you’re seated however, you’re going to want to hang around, for the raw and friendly pub atmosphere and array of nice beers to drink.<br>",

Preserved fixtures and fittings, old fashioned décor, carpeted floor, stylish furniture and each table featuring a classic Singer sewing machine with the foot operated spindle underneath.<br>Furthermore, the strength of the bar is in its ability to adapt from snoozy decorous café by day, to dusky evening venue and onto raucous partying by night (very late night). <br>The service is no more than adequate, and the beer options peak at Ksiasece, which has always been the better of the mainstream selection, very pleasant without being superb.

It therefore falls into that slight hinterland between restaurant and pub, never really feeling like it’s just a pub. <br>However, there are a few things that compensate for this. Firstly, the décor is fairly ramshackle and traditional, with some gothic/religious themes going on, as well as some pretty common pub-type features. Dark wood furniture, wrought iron, hanging beams. It does well to invoke the feel of a pub. It’s also warm and comfortable inside in the same way a large English pub doing meals would be. <br>Their beers are the stars of the show, with a core range all of which are above par for microbreweries, and touch a reasonable baseline standard for Belgian beer overall. The extra benefit is that they are as fresh as could be, thicker than normal Belgian ale and served in English style dimpled mugs and pint glasses. Having a beer in Domus is a pleasure, indeed it could unwittingly take over an entire afternoon. <br>When I visited it had begun raining outside, and after the first couple I started secretly hoping the rain would continue to give me an excuse to stay.<br>Food is a sideshow as far as this blog is concerned, but just to mention that my steak frites was fresh and well cooked – the quality really showed. <br>Have a good look around the place, as there are plenty of different feeling points to sit. There are a couple of tables by the bar area that are very strongly akin to a pub. This would be your best port of call. <br>It’s difficult to picture what happens here on an evening, as to whether it evolves into a drinking destination, particularly as Leuven’s Oude Markt so clearly supplies many places for that. My suspicion, and this is the main drawback really, is that Domus has forgotten one of the clearest principles of a pub – making a hangout space for people who just want to pop by and have a pint. The inevitable consequence is a one paced, albeit very nice and cosy lunch, following into afternoon pub, that doesn’t have the feel of a venue with a clutch of locals flocking to it. Given a central brewery should be the epitome of such a place, you have to say that there is still much work to do",

Being a university town in Western Europe, the obligation to fulfil drinking and partying needs obviously has something to do with that. <br>While there’s clearly something to be said for the atmosphere on the Markt, the bars themselves don’t really stand out, and simply churn out a fairly familiar café bar feel, presumably as they have a captive audience and a slightly transient one at that.<br>The best pub I could find in Leuven was just off the Markt. Metafoor seems to have carved out a careful niche attracting the snoozy one-beer an hour chin stroking sorts that frequent brown cafes (ie. me), and offering a fairly friendly, upbeat space and mood that gives it the facility to change pace when the hordes of boozers arrive.<br>Although the bar is a pleasant place, there is itself a little further room for improvement, as I didn’t really feel the place was exploring a sense of identity enough, and still felt rather upright. Perhaps too much light comes in from the indoors during the day, and some of the homely pub qualities it could be taking on is lost. There is no doubt the place becomes packed during the evening as the bar area has that natural footfall type space that you can see has been hewn over the years.<br>The beer choice is selective, but very well chosen, with some interesting stuff on tap such as Rodenbach Grand Cru (does anyone still drink the standard stuff anymore when that exists?), some other ales on rotation and a modest but again well selected bottle menu. It’s Belgium, so we’re starting at a very good point anyway.<br>Leuven lies somewhere between large important feeling town and provinciality, and Metafoor is like the bar equivalent of that, with plenty of likable elements, and certainly a superior option even when taking Belgium in general. It would be remiss though not to point out the opportunities that are there for it to be even better.",

I still regard an ‘inn’ as qualifying for the purposes of this website, which is something Sokol certainly is.<br>A country tavern, with all that involves may feel out of place in a city centre, but it’s so enormous inside, room after room of tables, and so lacking in natural light that the lamps are lit all through the day. The end result is to block out nearly everything going on outside, while everything going on really does feel like a country venue. The use of space mean you are never really staring at anything that doesn’t look like it could be a pub room in the country.<br>Gostilnas exist to fill your stomach with huge plates of country cooking, and Sokol doesn’t disappoint on this score, with a large menu of hearty food, leaning towards casseroles, soups and marinades to further pep up the well sourced and well cooked meat and veg. <br>Slovenia might give some people out-dated images of war torn Balkan states, but best to dispel that image straight away. This place is an hour or so’s drive from Italy, the country is in the Eurozone and is a prosperous dynamic country brimming with natural advantages that independence has allowed them to wield to good effect. Prices correspond to this, and even more so given the city centre location. Sokol is not the place to go for good value, but at least delivers on its end of the bargain in terms of quality – the food is delicious. As our server said, “For you this is excellent, for us this is normal.”<br>There is a dedicated bar area, albeit a very small one, so don’t be disheartened if you only want a drink. As usual, it’s too small, but these are the cultural quirks you will find around Europe.<br>Sokol serves Union and Lasko, both pretty disappointing lagers (particularly Union, Ljubljana’s anonymous and pitiful contribution to brewing), and they do a house beer (read: brewed elsewhere with a label slapped on it), which must surely be worth a try given the paucity of options. Sadly Slovenia isn’t exactly brilliant for beer right now, and despite the proximity to Austria, and heritage in the old Austrian empire, doesn’t offer much to get excited about, even considering imports. <br>For this reason, the good food and hearty homely feel of an inn is crucial to a successful experience, and it is these elements, along with the history of the place that propel Sokol up the charts to being an essential Inn to stop off at for a meal and a drink.",

Capitalism and communism combined to crush these during the second half of the twentieth century, but now personal freedom and economic freedom has returned, it’s burgeoning again, with all sort of breweries. Minibreweries in hotels and restaurants, more serious concerns exporting their beers and competing in regional competitions. In Czechia they weren’t hit as hard as most, indeed their medium sized breweries have proved extraordinarily resilient considering the existential threats they faced. It’s clear both in Czechia and elsewhere that brewing is back, big time.<br>Sometimes a town brewery can help elevate an otherwise prosaic place in some subtle ways you wouldn’t think of. In Czechia many successful breweries are often located in rather anonymous towns you wouldn’t pay a visit to, but some, like Pivovar Svaty Florian, a microbrewery, just add the cherry on top of what is an already impressive place.<br>Loket is a hill town based on a sweeping peninusula, a large river surrounded by steep forested banks. The road down into town provides you with a spectacular scene, a dainty central European town capped off by a medieval castle perched on a rocky promontory. <br>The whole town is an ideal day trip from Karlovy Vary and although small, there’s plenty of enjoyment to be had with a castle visit, pacing the streets, the town ‘square’, and wandering around the perimeter. <br>Stop off for lunch at Pivovar Svaty Florian which offers a nice range of beers, made using some small batch equipment you will see at the far end of the cellar. It’s a serious concern rather than an afterthought, but I don’t know whether there is anyone on site itself doing the maintenance or the brewing, or whether they contract that aspect and sort the day-to-day stuff out themselves. The best of the brews by far is their delicious special beer, similar to a bock style, strong with fantastic blend of sweet and bitter. There was nothing wrong at all with the others, mind you.<br>The pub area is based on the spot of the malt house for Loket’s previous brewery, closed in the 1950s and is attached to a hotel. As you’d expect for a tourist spot, there is largely passing trade, and this pleasant enough cellar bar/restaurant provides a typical but not out of the ordinary spot for lunch or dinner, although if you stay in Loket for the night, please let me know where you went for a beer.<br>So, in response to the question ‘alright, so where do we go for a beer’ in your day trip to Loket, Svaty Florian supplies a decent cellar pivnice and pretty tasty beer. While nothing about it is mind-blowing, that doesn’t matter when you’re already in a place like Loket.",

Lublin’s old town provides a pocket-sized but decent array of options, varying from Czech-themed pubs, computer game pubs (a new idea), a Pivnice style cellar brewery, craft ale hideouts and the most pub like of all, Sw. Michal. <br>Being based on ul. Grodska ensures some steady passing trade, but Sw. Michal makes the slight error of marketing itself as a restaurant, when actually the venue most suits a pub, a meeting place where yes, food is consumed, but the general point should be to dive in from the cold, huddle around the fire and drink.<br>This will be apparent on your couple of steps up and swing through the door, being greeted by dark wood, portraits lining most available space on the wall, the roaring fire at the side of the room and the pub like bar area at the back. Take a glance up at the ceiling for a fabulous inset design and some vaulted beams.<br>Despite the efforts at traditionality, the place has clearly been recently fitted out, and there are some slightly tacky/modern concessions, but if they stick with it, the venue should age well. The dusky ambience inside, as well as the crackling fireplace gives it only one tempo. Slow and comfortable.<br>Sw. Michal offers a quirky take on pizza using Lublin’s own bread cebularz, which works well as a high-end take on deep pan pizza, and is pretty cheap. There are an array of other options and staff are pleasant and eager to please.<br>Sw. Michal does a couple of its ‘own’ beers, the best of which is a delicious semi-dark ale, and there are some reasonable other options, most of which are out of the standard Polish beer playbook.<br>Both food and drink are reasonably priced, both in terms of Poland in general versus the UK, and in comparison to its local competitors.<br>There are quite a few options to explore in Lublin’s old town and university area, so you may find time to go here only the once, but to me this place could become a classic local haunt if they stripped back some of the townier elements and make a few tweaks. There are some great raw materials here and it’s a very enjoyable place to go for a pub meal and a pint.<br>A: 7/10 B: 8/10 C: 7/10 D: 7/10 E: 8/10 F: 8/10",

Given the venue itself doesn’t offer anything in terms of décor or atmosphere beyond any other clean-lined generic bar, it’s interesting to have a dig in and explore why that is.<br>After all, Germany has some terrific traditional beers, and is in fact parochial and patrician about that fact. The reinheitsgebot even prevents them from making the kinds of beer craft ale thrives on (additional ingredients).<br>Could its popularity be simply down to sheeplike trend following? I went to Bierwerk in Nuremberg with this question in mind. <br>Although craft ale bars rely heavily on the quality of their output, I have been to quite a few that have extraordinarily dull choices and overrated drinks masquerading as trendy, luxury products. It’s just no-one of significance has called them out on it yet. Undoubtedly though, when they get the choice right and keep the beers well, they only require an inoffensive bar area and a reasonable atmosphere to make their bar worth a visit. They may never become as loveable as a trusted pub but they’re certainly eligible for a quality beer on a pub crawl.<br>Bierwerk fits this aspiration comfortably, as the beer choice is a sensible mixture of local and regional beer, craft ale from German breweries, and a few Belgian, Czech beer, English and US beers. It speaks of a holistic and meritorious approach rather than a slavish obsession with US craft brewing. It was also fortunate as for my visit I drank the most delicious dunkelweizen I’ve had for a long time, which made me extremely happy.<br>Certainly for the wealth of choice and quality of beer available, Bierwerk will not disappoint. As mentioned, it’s thronged with locals, especially in the evenings. There’s even decent (ie. non-contemporary chart) music. However, when you look around, you won’t find anything notable about the décor or the format, nor is it especially comfortable which is a great shame as it inherently limits how highly I can rate the place. When you have gone to the trouble of putting so much great product together why build such a generic and featureless place to drink it in? Look at the name of the place!<br>There is a stunted ambition borne from trying to mistakenly copy elements of craft beer bars that aren’t why people visit. No-one goes to a craft ale bar for the exposed industrial chic unless it is in such a dramatic or tasteful setting as to make it actually stand out. People are here for the beer. The beer is excellent – meaning you have absolute freedom to make the bar in any shape or form you desire, so as to elevate the venue even further. They haven’t managed that, which is a real shame, but the beer is excellent, really, really excellent.",

Nuremberg’s centre is divided up between north and south of the river. The North side is the historical and cultural centre, while the south side, still pretty and smart, is mainly taken up with the everyday shopping streets. Bar Fuesser is situated here and provides the traditional German Bierkeller experience, as well as brewing its own stuff on tap.<br>Until recently the historical centre on the North side had no operating brewery, until Altstadthof came along. The brewery have taken up residence in a mini-complex, bigger than it first appears but certainly compact, on the street leading up to Albrecht Durer’s house and what seems to be the natural focal point of the city. There is a certain strategic advantage to this, picking up touristic footfall as the hordes make the pilgrimage past the attractive fachwerk houses and up the hill to the castle. The question is, have they made a pub or bar that locals actually go to?<br>Altstadthof isn’t exactly in prime location if you’re a local, but the general answer is yes. You’ll find a core crowd congregating around the bar and the shelf lining the wall, while the bench seats seem to be a mixture of business groups, romantic couples and the odd group of youngsters. <br>The biggest surprise is that the pub is so small, as for a brewery in a city the size of Nuremberg, you would expect at least an upstairs area, but no, it’s just the main room which for now appears to be doing its duty.<br>They have made an intelligent choice to kit the place out in traditional fashion with sturdy bench seats, studded leather upholstery, wooden beams and some tasteful decoration. It still has that ‘new’ feel, but has character and it will develop further character over time.<br>As for the beer, well, that’s another reason the pub is included, as their range is all very decent. You can enjoy bock and rotbier on tap, something not commonly available everywhere, and both are delicious. Their core range starts at good and peaks at really good. There’s nothing to worry about drinks wise here other than the overly lively tapping, whereby the by-now jaded bar staff scoop the mounds of foam off the beers, usually taking 2 or 3 glasses just to fill a 0.4l serving. This inevitably takes time, making your wait beyond Guinness level to the point that where your drink eventually arrives, you’re gagging for it.<br>There’s a really friendly and surprisingly low-key feel to an evening in here. It feels communal, it is literally a pub, rather than a brasserie or brewery tap, and they’ve succeeded in making a vital addition to pubgoing in Nuremberg.",

I was put onto this place by a guy from Maine called Luke who was running the craft ale bar Mr Kennedy’s and given the quality of the stout I had just drunk, he seemed like a decent enough judge.<br>Kater Murr is a backstreet kind of place that you’d never know about if you didn’t live here, as there’s not enough of a presence when doing research online for it to ever stand out. With my map and gps on I slowly arced left around an unlit backstreet wondering where the hell it was taking me, until Kater Murr’s doorway appeared.<br>The venue is relatively bright for an evening visit, as it doubles as a quiet studenty café and reading spot by day. When you walk in there is a large rectangular space with light wooden seating lining the walls and large windows with books and games stacked on the ledges. It’s busy but not so bad that you can’t find a table or a bar stool, and large enough that no-one will stare at you for walking in alone, or even in a group.<br>The drinks selection is pretty good for a so-called café (it’s a bar) with typical Franconian beers and some more unusual bottles including craft ale representation. Even better is the price, bargain basement for German standards, and I picked up a 500ml bock beer for 2 euros 50 cents.<br>You can’t bottle the sort of vitality imbued in a place when it’s clearly at the peak of its lifespan, which Kater Murr clearly is. Often a place can start to look a little tired and passe once its glory years have passed but Kater Murr doesn’t have to worry about that just yet. There are plenty of amenities, food, games, books, live music and community events which all count in its favour and maintain its reason for being.<br>I really liked the space and the atmosphere and couldn’t really suggest too many improvements, other than perhaps a few more decorations on the walls, and a more pubby feeling bar area.

You can sit down and just have a beer anywhere, much in the way you can at a chain pub in England, but there is a dedicated bar area too with the predictable footy and hockey memorabilia and sport on TV.<br>In the main, Na Parkanu is a fairly by-the-by venue and in local terms a tad expensive by virtue of self-awareness of its own importance.<br>Why the fuss then?<br>It serves a special beer that is vanishingly difficult to obtain in unfiltered form, and there is always a tinge of excitement at the prospect of drinking at the ‘place to be’. That’s enough in itself on this occasion, as the venue doesn’t really have any weak points other than failing to fulfil my desire for it to be wonderfully old historic and traditional, which is hardly its fault. Basically, a trip to Plzen that doesn’t include a pint of unfiltered PU at Na Parkanu would feel strangely hollow and lacking.This is something that I and the Google reviewers seem to agree on.<br>If you want to step out of the sameyness, try some of the intimidating looking ‘food to go with beer’ options on the menu, and wash it down with the gorgeous beer - you’ll soon be transported into a fatty, gristly, and delicious world of true Czech pub going – halitosis central but very satisfying at the time.",

It must be due to the tonnes of old communist bric-a-brac that has been purloined from flea markets over the years. It’s remarkable how quickly this ephemera has been regurgitated, often in an apolitical way. Now, shorn of the memory of state repression, paranoia and hardship much of the era’s junk has been re-purposed and exhibited, capturing people’s nostalgic fondness for the idealism, optimism as well as the iconography of the era. Ideal for adorning a moody Polish bar so as this one in Poznań.<br><br>Proletaryat isn’t exactly lined with volumes of Das Kapital; instead you’ll note a large bust of Lenin staring at you out on the street. Enter to find a display of fairly impressive social realist paintings, disproportionately large portraits of Lenin and Marx, hung in front of rich crimson paint, with emblems and military insignia thrown in. The central bar area also expands further into an interesting looking terrace-style back room where the cool kids hang out, that seems a little separated from the central premise.<br><br>There may be a vague leftist feel to the crowd here (perhaps its just the students) but in the main it does seem to be led by decoration rather than a hotbed of any political grouping.<br><br> <br>That said, the decoration is impressive nonetheless, it’s a very stylish place to go for a drink, without being particularly pretentious. The crimson and lamplight works well for a shady atmospheric slow sup, while at night it gets more raucous and one of those truly buzzing city centre bars where the lack of space and abundance of booze creates its own head of steam. This is a great example of decoration that allows a venue to work well in different ways at different times.<br><br>The location down one of the main city centre streets means it feels in the middle of the action – which in Poznan is pretty bloody active. You can expect to witness the type of revelry usually preserved for English city centres on an evening. It was quite an eye-opener, but I had previously been warned about it by some Poznanites (Poznanians?) during a separate trip to Wroclaw (another excellent city). The levity doesn’t emerge from English stag parties or boys-on-tour either – in Poznan it’s mainly locals doing their homespun thing. Wodka i piwo can be a dangerous combo.<br><br>Aside of the tongue-in-cheek atmosphere, Proletaryat offers its ‘own’ beer as well (from what I can gathered, this is brewed elsewhere at Browar Czarnków and labelled accordingly), which is cheap even by Polish standards nowadays. The jasne (light) and ciemne (dark) beers are both fresh and well balanced. Not the finest ever brewed but tasty certainly and designed to knock back in volume. Apparently the vodka is served with a pickle here if you are interested in going native.<br><br>Any pub crawl around Poznań would be improved by a stop off at Proletaryat, as despite the increasingly familiar concept of the Soviet-themed bar, a good concept doesn’t stop being good just on account of its familiarity. Besides, they do a decent job of and it feels like its own thing rather than a cookie-cutter version or a clone-bar. If you haven’t been to one of these type of places before, then go at least once for the novelty value. If you already have and enjoyed it, then this bar is not to be missed!",

As you often find, there is a tapster area but unlike some pubs this is only usually used during busy periods, and the tapster is otherwise obliged to (shock-horror) actually engage with the general public.<br><br>You’ll find around 8-12 beers on tap, usually a choice mature selection of regional Czech ales, one or two short term German or Polish kegs and a desitka lager should anyone simply want to get down to business. The beer is excellent, offering genuine competition to the usual big beers, but look out for some rarer microbrews from across the country including their connection at Kostenec nad Cernymi Lesy.<br><br>It all sounds great so far, but sadly the restaurant aspect of the pub and the choice of furnishings does somewhat detract from the pub feel, and it never really strikes a comfortable balance, teetering between dedicated lunch and evening meal spot and drinking hole. They ideally want you to eat a full meal then hang around downing a series of glasses, but in reality there’s too much going on in Zizkov, let alone Prague in general for that to be a judicious use of time. This is a frequent problem with Czech pubgoing, the blurring between dining and boozing.<br><br>It depends which night you come and which crowds are in. Sometimes it is full of dedicated drinkers (the best time to come) other times you might feel slightly, just slightly out on a limb sitting there with only a pint.<br><br>There is a beauty to the simple stylings of the place as well as the beer selections which invite further inspection. The food is purportedly pretty good by any local standards. It stands to reason that this is a venue to merit serious consideration as you plan your choices of pub crawl/lunch from the many hundreds (yes, hundreds) of viable options around Prague.

When you’ve stood outside the place and inspected the tiny pub entrance, and the oblique surrounding buildings it appears at first impossible to conceive such a space would be downstairs.<br><br>It’s also a restaurant and there is a dining area, but this place at least couldn’t be clearer of its core purpose – it’s an enormous beer hall. <br><br>Be Warned: If you decide to eat this pub is notorious for sharp practise such as 'couvert charges', with bread and condiments added to your bill even if you ask for it without, and attempts by staff to cleave tips which is not practise in Prague. <br><br>We recommend sticking to beer, which is very reasonably priced for the city centre, and you won't be expected to tip for a round or two.<br><br>The raw materials of this pub speak for themselves. If you like your impressive beer hall surroundings, a great pub atmosphere and quality Czech lager, there's a very good chance you'll enjoy yourself at U Vejvodu.<br><br>It’s a classic Prague beer hall.

The Pivnice is a format that tourism can’t change, and U Medvidku is another venue that delivers on that promised format, adding a little something extra in the process.<br>Yes, there’s cream walls, curved ceilings, wooden bench seatings and that sense of institutionalised grandeur even in the mere size of the building itself. If you’re seeking out that Prague pub atmosphere, you won’t go wrong coming here.<br>The tap beer in Medvidku, surprisingly, is a Budvar rather than Pilsner Urquell, a reasonably rare sight around the city. It’s pristine, as you’d expect, but look further around the place, have a wander. There’s more than meets the eye.<br>There’s a pub within a pub serving their own brewed beer Old Gott, a special beer (similar to a German bock) of hefty strength but masses of flavour. Depending on the season they will usually be brewing one or two others, so don’t miss the chance to try a glass of something else as well as the Bud.<br>Make sure to explore the premises and take your seat in the place that most fits your needs, be that a quick dive in through the front for a pint, or a meal in the pivnice or a secret glass of the good stuff upstairs in the ante room. There’s plenty to U Medvidku and I must confess even I don’t feel like I’ve truly explored it. <br>U Medvidku has okay reviews, partly on account of some ridiculous expectations of absolute dweebs that come to Prague but comes highly recommended from the beer drinking and pub going fraternity and for good reason, none other than Pivni Filosof Max Bahnson has included it in his list of Prague Pub Crawls and I echo that. (Founder Member 2017)",

The layout, the fixtures, the fittings, the beer, the style of service, all correspond to an archetype of traditional Czech pub going. <br>I think U Rudolfina knows this quite well, and fortunately for all concerned, has no intentions of changing.<br>Walking through the door brings you to the pub area, designed purely for stop-off drinking, a kind of glass and be-on-your-way kind of thing. This smallish area attracts a host of locals and tends to put off tourists who prefer to dive straight down to the cellar.True, the bar part of the pub gives you only a sliver of the experience but it’s a really good one.<br>This is another of the Pilsner Urquell tankovna pubs and they take a real care and pride at keeping it at pristine quality. There’s something you can sense just from observing the glacial smoothness of the foam on a head of a jar of Pilsner Urquell that sends off all the right signals that you’re about to enjoy a very good pint.<br>By the limited parameters of Czech customer service, it’s actually fairly friendly in here. Eye contact, a mutual acknowledgement of each other’s humanity, and on occasion I’ve found almost a sense of satisfaction at delivering the good stuff to the table, in that stodgy matter of fact manner, yes, but you take every victory you can get. Prices are just a little inflated but that extra 20 pence a jar won’t hurt British wallets.<br>As for the Pivnice, you couldn’t say fairer than the fare offered here. Straight down the line Czech dishes, a roll call of the 6-8 dishes you could probably find at every Czech restaurant in the country, made to a very enjoyable if not absolutely distinctive standard, something underlined by the reviews online even those by hardened idiots.<br>If you’re alone, stick to the bar area and hang out with the locals. If you’re in a group dive downstairs and get drinking and dining post-haste in a cellar area brimming with all the history and good cheer you would expect from a Czech pivnice. This is core Czech pub territory.",

With a name translating to ‘Tomcat’, you’d be forgiven for interpreting the wrong kind of signals, but don’t worry, it’s no dodgy gentleman’s club, nor a stag-party venue, this unassuming bar is hidden away in a courtyard minding its own business.<br>Runcis is happy being a very low key meeting place, with an atmosphere similar to a pub. The plain decor and simple functional furniture couldn’t indicate clearer your reason to be here. Whether it’s to read a book, play board games or discuss issues over a pint or two, Runcis shows a truer side to contemporary Latvia.<br>However, like a lot of true Latvian pubs it’s also open late, until 2am most nights, making Runcis a great option to have in your back pocket for a late drink if the seedier bars don’t appeal. There are also a few bench seats in the courtyard which is a really pleasant place for a drink in spring/summer.<br>This isn’t to say the atmosphere is non-existent by any means. There is a pleasant feel to hanging out here, and some good music too. It does become lively when it is busy, but it is the hubbub of conversation, rather than thumping bass or laddishness that provides the soundtrack.<br>There are 4 or 5 tapped beer options, mostly of a local slant which are of varying quality and compared to most old town venues they are sold at a snip, so cheap in fact that you feel a bit of a skinflint complaining over the incompetently uneven heads on the beers poured.<br>Runcis isn’t going to take your breath away, but it’s a vital inclusion both in its style and situation, and comes highly recommend to anyone not in Riga to thunderdown steins of Aldaris with large groups of lads while thinking of hilarious forfeits.",

There’s no point being too sniffy about it though, it’s not a bad beer by any means, especially if you can drink the tank stuff which gets sent across the city, or if you visit the brewery itself, where the best tasting Sarajevsko can be found.<br>The brewery is located close to the centre, so can be joined on to any pub crawl near the old town fairly easily. The building sticks out like a sore thumb, as it was a concern of the Austro-Hungarian empire, so you won’t have any trouble finding it, but even if you do, the enormous backlit sign will guide you there.<br>Over time the locals have grown an attachment to it, having gradually appreciated it to be an asset and a source of jobs rather than grumbling about it being some imperial vestige (astonishingly some people still have a problem despite the Empire ceasing to exist over a century ago)<br>Once you arrive, keep heading through the doors in order to find another shock, as the pivnica inside is a grand beer hall with a theatrical shape, a central area surrounded by balcony levels. This isn’t some modest pale imitation of another country, it would be impressive were it in Munich or Vienna. Opulent would be the word. Take a seat and before long one of the ambling rotund servers will approach. ‘Pivo molim’ if you’re on your own, ‘piva molim’ if you’re in a group. <br>The beers are served in sturdy dimpled mugs and are fresh as you’re ever likely to get. The ‘tamno’ dark larger is much more generic, and probably best avoided out of winter unless you’re trying to increase your count on Untappd. Sources reveal they are bringing out an unfiltered larger which is something I’d encourage anyone to try straight away.<br>As it’s such a large venue, it does require the patronage of large groups to build the atmosphere. It has a sense that it isn’t ever busier than ‘ticking over’, but neither does it feel particularly abandoned. There’s a pleasant atmosphere as the disparate conversations bounce across the room. Take a moment to explore the bar area and the upstairs, as it really is a grand place.<br>The beer won’t set you back more a few Bosnian marks, so there’s no impediment to staying here for the duration and getting sloshed.<br>Keep an eye out for the museum and lunch deal, if you’re coming during the day, which at 12 euros 50 represents pretty good value.<br>It’s always interesting seeing attempts to transplant one culture into another, and this Pivnica allows you to experience this AND go to the pub. A slight improvement to the beer and the atmosphere aside, it’s fascinating, brilliant and comes highly recommend.",

Sigulda in Latvia reduced late night drinking options substantially to the point where we were having to visit hotel bars in the early evening, and even considering visiting a Casino on the edge of town.<br>Thankfully, the Kaku Maja complex (now upgraded to Valhalla) saved us from what would otherwise have been some very drab nights out. Part hotel, part apartments, part restaurant, part buffet, part everything, it’s like someone trying to create a global conglomerate entirely within their back garden.<br>Rebranded Valhalla, this place offers an updated offering from the homely hangout that preceded it.

Nevertheless, paying between a few euros for a beer isn’t going to hurt.<br>The place stays open til 11-12 at night which isn’t ideal, and once that has happened it’s either a trip to the casino, or bed/drinking at home after that. <br>It’s an essential drinking base if staying in Sigulda, particularly if you aren’t driving, so make yourself at home, have a few games of pool and sit back and relax, which is generally the point of being in Sigulda to start with.

Similarly, you don’t get the flavour of local life in quite the same way, for all the great things about them.<br>To find out what’s going on locally find a Kneipe, where the average German heads in the evening for a beer and a chat. These are very close in style to an English pub, usually beamed, traditionally styled and cosy, though they also tend to be distinctly more working class in feel and far less concerned about décor or fripperies.<br>Tommis Pub is a classic example. Wernigerode is the centre of operations for any holiday in the Harz region and as with most German towns it has its own brauhaus. There’s nothing wrong with the brauhaus per se. The service is good, beer is reasonably good and there’s been plenty of money spent. It just fails almost altogether to conjure up any character or local life.<br>In order to experience that, get down to Tommis, a busy dark wood beamed pub with that typical country town atmosphere, lively and chatty, and rather smokey still. It could hardly be less pretentious – the beers are sturdy Harz offerings (the best of which is a delicious schwarzbier) for reasonable prices, there’s sport on telly in the corner, the crowd around the place are gregarious, and the low ceilings, lack of windows and narrow shape give that nice reassurringly cosy feel that invites you to stay for another one.<br>It’s also right next to Wernigerode’s dramatic town square which makes it ideal for a bleary-eyed wander when you stumble out of the pub at kicking out time.

Otherwise, your options are identikit café terraces or the odd raucous rakija bar. To be honest, a night out spent solely Zagreb’s old town would be pretty bland unless you dedicated yourself to drinking shots, or visited this place.<br><br>Mali Medo acts as brewery tap for Pivovara Medvedgrad (translates as Beartown), named after an old fortress in the hills North of the city which has undergone a rather appalling renovation, but is worth seeking out for the view over the city.<br><br>The brewery, operating since 1994 precedes the craft beer craze and concocts a range of different beers – including their own attempt at Kriek – highly peculiar by Croatian standards where anything outside Euro Lager seems to be regarded as otherworldly. Their beers aren’t unpleasant but they’re some way short of the wider standard these days and a bit ‘last generation’. Nevertheless, a couple of the more traditional styles are competent enough to put away a few of, and the extra flavour and freshness will come as a relief after drinking the likes of Karlovacko everywhere else.<br><br>They operate a number of pubs, but the best of the lot is, in my opinion Mali Medo in the centre of town.<br><br>The pub itself has a typical pivnica look, dropping down off the main cobbled street to a large half-basement area with a curved ceiling, and some partitioned niches with bench seating (one of my favourite pub features) along with the typical long tables you’d expect of a central European cellar pub. Mostly, the décor is in-keeping with inn-keeping, wooden framed artwork on the wall, and traditional furniture, a step above bland. It’s suitably cavernous in order to cram in the many hundreds of people who flock to it daily – worth a reminder at this stage that it is the number one venue slap bang in the centre of town.<br><br> <br>As there is a beer terrace out front with much coming and going the atmosphere is very noisy and lively, sometimes pierced by live music performances. The upstairs area serves as a stage, with performers opening the windows to serenade people on the street. Very unusual and atmospheric. You get the picture that this is one of the cultural hubs of the city. Be warned, if you’re after peace and quiet, this isn’t the place for you.<br><br>As with most pivnicas there is food available. Sometimes this can turn a place too much like a restaurant, but here it blends in with people turning up for a drink of beer better than some others, and as the evening progresses you can tell this is chiefly a drinking spot – good.<br><br>Considering the hustle and bustle, service is actually not too bad until it comes to the point of paying, where you almost have to grab the staff by the lapels and shove the money into their pockets. As per usual, table service slows up the whole arrangement. This is a very inefficient method when you compare it to those mega-brauhauses in Germany and Austria where a tapster and a token system means hundreds can be catered for by just a few people, or simply an English pub with a big bar where you can walk up to the bar staff and order – sort yourself out rather than relying on others to carry a glass for you. Unfortunately in Eastern Europe there appears to be an unwritten rule that one must never ever approach the person pouring the beer, or expect them to be able to operate a till.<br><br>Any place, city, town or village automatically feels enhanced by a centrally located brewery and/or its taproom, and this is certainly the effect Mali Medo has had on Zagreb old town. There is some work to do on the beers themselves, and it would be nice to see a few more pub touches, just slightly, to add character. It wouldn’t be an 8/10 unless there was some constructive criticism to encourage improvements. Aside of this, it still remains an essential, indeed desperately vital place to go for a beer in Zagreb.",

A 5 minute walk through the centre will take you past a dozen pubs, each of which remain open for business.<br>My favourite by some distance is the Yarbrough Hunt, based on a small back street over the river which implausibly has three pubs within a stone’s throw of each other.<br>The pub building is one of those typical venerable townhouses you find across the East of England with weathered brickwork and an architectural style calling up stereotypes of genteel English country life. <br>The Yarbrough manages to do a country pub in a slightly different way to some, with some specific rustic touches, and eschewing most newer pub features. It isn’t an ‘Inn’ by any stretch, as there is no food, it isn’t large or homely enough for that. It’s a workmanlike barn type pub, and I mean that in a very good way.<br>You will notice the exposed beams and tiled floor instantly when you walk in. Take a few steps to your left to enter the bar area where the ceiling has been removed to expose barn style rafters which gives it a characterful feel. The central area of the pub is mainly tiled but there are comfortable carpeted areas in the ante rooms to your left and right with huge sturdy wooden bench seats. <br>Almost a pre-requisite, the fire is going nearly 8 months a year which adds a warm cosy feel to the otherwise upright and uncushioned main pub area. <br>Despite being a pub, the place seems to do a majority café style trade during the day, as young families, old fogies and retirees potter down to drink coffee and read the paper. However, there are some reliable intransigents propping up the bar drinking ale, and when you look at the range of options it’s clear these guys have the right idea over everyone else.<br>Rather unusually, the Yarborough has a multitap keg ale panel behind the bar in addition to several cask pumps in front. It’s a curiosity in an otherwise old fashioned place, but the joy is that there are several unusual beers to try. Yes, they really have taken a step up with the range of offerings here. Despite the very decent and rotating cask ale options,<br>During the evening the Yarbrough does thankfully escape second gear, with a different crowd gathering. I would recommend sitting towards the end of the bar area for the most atmosphere as the fairy lights around the beams and general ambience around the bar is something to take in.<br>They have made some strange design decisions in some of the smaller side rooms which are wholly regrettable and not in keeping with inn-keeping, but hopefully soon someone will see sense and consolidate the whole pub back to its core.<br>There were also some wranglings in the last few years with the owner Tom Woods whose mediocre ales (sorry, but its true) were being outsold, unsurprisingly, by the other, superior options. It seems that this has now been resolved by the sheer variety on offer.<br>However, despite the usual provincial quirks that stop the Yarbrough reaching its potential, the pub is run by a very enterprising lady and a core of committed employees that are clearly proud and determined of the pub. This shows in nearly everything the pub does, and despite the healthy competition for bums on seats in Brigg, they enjoy committed repeat custom, quite rightly.<br>I have no hesitation in recommending paying a visit if you’re anywhere near Brigg.

However, be sure to check behind the bar for some interesting drinks choices, and hang around in the evening for some local village life.<br><br>After a brutal 20 minute ascent from Hebden Bridge to the beautiful and ancient village of Heptonstall your reward after the labour, sweating and panting is lunch and a pint at the lovely White Lion pub in Heptonstall, set right out onto the cobbled street looking very much as it would have done for 100 years.<br>The central location allows the White Lion to claim a spot as the epicentre of community goings on, while also serving as a stopping-off point for day-trippers and hikers, eager to experience the historic atmosphere of Heptonstall.<br>The pub itself is divided into a traditional bar and pub area with a fairly elegant wooden paneled bar, and a rather genteel dining area which either needs to age substantially or be replaced entirely, I’m not sure which.<br>Many people will be here for the pub grub, which delivers on the ‘Yorkshire Portions’ stereotype, particularly the meat and potato pie which looks as though it was cut using a snow shovel. However, the drinks selection is pretty impressive for a village pub, with a range of classic and local real ales, as you could expect, but some decent export lagers and a bottle selection that covers a few European styles. The food is decent value, and the drinks, steady value. The staff will be pleased to serve you at any time of day.<br>The White Lion is a considerably better pub than its more gruff, down to Earth neighbour The Cross Inn which had gone too far the other way with lowest common denominator stuff all round, and on a last viewing had closed down. However it looks from recent evidence to have been taken over, in which case a very short crawl between the two pubs would be desirable.<br>Folk music and community events are also at the heart of The White Lion’s success and despite the lofty location and exertion to reach it, there is much to recommend doing so. Head up The Buttress, a pack horse lane that is now overgrown and horribly uneven, and follow the steps up from across the main road at the top. At the top of those stairs walk 100 metres further up the road into Heptonstall and you’ve made it. Not for the faint-hearted, I warned you.<br>The White Lion is a classic Yorkshire pub with much to recommend it.",

With the brewery little more than a car park with the original office functioning as a museum and ‘art space’, the pub attracts a different crowd these days.<br>It’s testament to the pub’s over-arching quality that it pulls in a range of ages and classes. Its proximity to a stack of post-grad city centre apartments is purely fortuitous, as the pub long pre-dates their existence, but gives it a stock of young customers with plenty of disposable income. However, it’s also only over the road from the tough Leeds pub The Old Red Lion, a venue I doubt many have even dared enter (but probably should do). Along with young types, there is a middle class, middle aged crowd who enjoy the refurbished, preened environment and some die hard working class folk who gather round the bar clawing at the brass and supping whatever’s the cheapest beer going. <br>The pub has changed hands a few times, but is currently staffed by people who know about good customer service, while the beers resolutely stay in the same format. 3 or 4 rotating cask pumps serving session cask ale, a couple of regulars, and a whole host of unnecessary surplus Euro lager. Nevertheless, there’s more than likely something there to suit your needs. The prices are rather high though.<br>Pleasingly, Adelphi have a number of community events and deals to sustain your interest. Pub quizzes, occasional upstairs gigs and events, drinks deals and so on all help give the impression of a pub actively courting custom and treating you, even if it is largely psychological.<br>Leeds needs to keep hold of the very few traditional pubs it has left in the centre, and Adelphi is no doubt among the best of those, taking everything into consideration. <br>(Added August 2023)",

Much of that has to do with the cultural setup, a stripped back format, no music, just simple tables, chairs and a bar, and old fashioned opening hours. It’s difficult to visit one without feeling as though you’re in a museum.<br>Sam Smiths are also known for being off-the-chart in terms of value for money, seemingly existing in another economy altogether, although that has started to change since the mid-00s, and particularly in London. Over the next decade or two, depending on how the business functions, this peculiarity, and with it, one of the main reasons to visit a Sam Smiths pub may vanish.<br>If you’ve never been in one before, then come to terms with the factor it doesn’t have any brands of anything other than their own stuff. Right down to the bottled cherry beer or the malt whiskey, everything is relabelled under their own brand, or made in-house. <br>A regular sight is a newcomer peering about as if they’ve wandered into a museum asking if they serve a ‘Carling or owt like that’. Don’t worry if this all seems like stepping into bizarro world, there are plenty of serviceable ales and lagers, most of which you can buy for at least £1 cheaper than you would get elsewhere.<br>Angel Inn has a great spot occupying one of the arcades off Brigate in Leeds. Whether approaching from the top or the bottom, the alley entrance is one of those irreplaceably atmospheric entrances to a pub, and gives you that tingling feeling. Once you step through the doors it really does feel as though modern Leeds which surrounds the pub has vanished. <br>This is a pub with plenty of space yet designed in a way that always feels homely. There’s a small drinking area at the bar which is a nice space, very old fashioned but sometimes difficult to prise away from the regulars. To the left of the entrance is the main lounge area where most of the more gnarled Leeds locals hang out.<br>Angel Inn’s greatest asset is throwing together classes of people that would otherwise choose to socialise apart from each other. It’s the combination of cheap drinks and down to earth venue (working class + students) with the central location and atmospheric historical venue (middle class) that creates this dynamic. <br>It isn’t healthy to exist in class cliques, never meeting, and the Angel is a great, and usually friendly way of associating with different people. <br>You’ll find the staff fairly gruff but fairly stolid. There’s another form of politeness I’ve discovered through visiting lots of Czech pubs which I can best describe as ‘greeted as equals’, and that’s how it’s like here. You’re acknowledged, served quickly and not judged, which I find respectful enough, but don’t expect many airs and graces, it’s just that type of place. <br>The best beers on offer are the thick session ale Old Brewery Bitter which can verge on overly toffee sweet at times but can be put away in vast quantities, and the genuinely good Extra Stout with a flavour and consistency that is a match for any regular stout, including a Dublin Guinness. Oddly enough, their outsourced fruit beers are rather good as well. I recommend the Taddy Lager over any others, which is a genuine steady lager beer with a real beer flavour. Try and steer clear from the increasingly poorly kept and expensive Wheat Beer, the overly floral gloopy Organic Lager and the Sovereign Bitter which is insipid. <br>If you want a night out on a tenner, a Sam Smiths pub is still the place to go. My favourite spot in the pub is upstairs by the window, looking out over the yard. It is a cosy, expansive lounge area with a thick carpet and crimson walls. Watching the lights coming on in the early evening and seeing the transition from day to night is one of the grea",

Strangely though, the snug’s creaking, exposed unupholstered seating still hasn’t been fixed. I thought the whole point of a snug was that it was…well…precisely.<br>There’s a great atmosphere in the concert room in the evening, though you may find it a tad cliquey as they close the door, which does provide some privacy for the other pubgoers (and allows them to charge on the door) but makes it a little intimidating when you first step in.<br>There are some wonderful preserved features, and it’s still worth having a little explore to enjoy them all. Sadly despite the signage offering John Smith’s Magnet, that retro beer bit the dust quite some time ago. <br>The beer offerings are another great reason to visit, focusing intently on cask real ale and cider, usually 3-4 good ales to go at. Prices are moderate but certainly on the higher side if you’ve arrived from somewhere like Sheffield for the evening.<br>The location near Bridgewater Place means it also attracts a mixed crowd, with some business people enjoying the down to earth environments along with the crusty bar flies and the odd gruff labourer popping in for a quick pint. Lots of young folk work in the vicinity, but Leeds youngsters are too-cool-for-school and wouldn’t be seen dead in a place like The Grove Inn, if you discount occasional chin stroking troubadour and their groupies who turn up for open mic nights.<br>In addition to all of this there is some sturdy and pretty inexpensive pub grub which emerges from a tiny kitchen adjacent to the bar. <br>Visit The Grove Inn while it still exists in its current form. You never know with Leeds, cultural vandalism comes second nature to people with more money than taste and it wouldn’t be at all surprising to see it being targeted for refurbishment by some genius with his finger on the pulse.<br>The Grove is a classic pub in many ways, a refreshingly workaday no B.S place to drink an immaculately kept cask ale and lounge around. Everything else is a plus, but when you strip all that back, it would still be worth visiting. (Added 2017)<br>",

Similarly, it manages to not be bland, sterile or mediocre despite many pressures that might lean it towards being so.<br>The building itself is a bit of a peculiarity as the street entrance at the front is considerably higher than the rear, meaning depending which one you take you end up in completely different parts of the pub. Although there’s a car park at the back, there is a beer garden which, until the terrible flooding in December 2015 was nice to sit out with river views and the eponymous bridge. For a year later you could still see the detritis everywhere around, the ‘grass’ under the pub furniture little more than grimy muck. Hopefully they’ve taken a pressure washer to it at this point, but you may find it nicer to get ye inside.<br>Unusually, you may find the ‘top floor’ the nicest area, with a cosy but spacious central room and a bar area looking through to a classic snug. If you can get a seat in the snug, definitely do so, as you have great access to the bar and have the most comfortable spot in the place.<br>Kirkstall Bridge is the de facto brewery tap for Kirkstall Brewery, operating 100 metres up the road. Even subtracting all their beers, the choice is excellent, with a nice blend of traditional cask ales and some interesting minor breweries and craft type brews. There’s also a committedly decent range of bottles – you won’t go far wrong for a beer in here. The only slight drawback is the expense, as the pub never approaches great value. Only the Kirkstall brewery beers could be seen to be anywhere near reasonable, and even then you’ll scratch your face wondering how they can ship the stuff many miles down the road and sell it cheaper than it is here. <br>As you’d expect, the pub is the centre point for Kirkstall’s social activities, a reasonably pleasant post-grad neighbourhood far more akin to Sheffield than some of the boroughs of Leeds that have been gutted of decent pubs. This gives it a sense of friendliness and youthful vibrancy without the pretentiousness that usually accompanies it in Leeds, and puts off people from other generations. It’s a down to earth crowd of various ages enjoying some great beers in a cosy community venue. With that, Kirkstall Bridge wins the right to appear here. (Added 2018)",

Although North Bar has always been expensive with erratic service, this format was a success and North Bar remained a staple venue in Leeds for over a decade.<br>Nevertheless, following a series of decidedly poor design choices, prices that seem to be lurching out of control, a decision to reposition itself as a US and British craft beer venue, and a whole host of competitors serving similar beer at better prices, North Bar finds itself in a far less enviable position.<br>North Bar’s raison d’etre for me during university days was discovering new European beers of various kinds. It’s arguably where I most developed my interest in German and Belgian beer for example, dipping across the bar and waggling my finger at whichever funky bottle caught my eye. At this point you could expect most of the bar taps to be doing likewise, yet most of these have gone, and the bottle selection appears to be little more than lip service these days as the focus has switched to serving American and UK ‘craft beers’. <br>With this switch, one of North Bar’s unique qualities has been lost, and instead it falls into a dozen or more similar places serving similar beer, just at higher prices. In order to recapture the magic they must seriously reconsider this craft scene sell-out and return to selling and promoting beers you can’t get elsewhere. <br>To make matters worse, the brown café feel has been degraded by the installation (in an already small narrow bar) or some tacky wooden strips along the ceiling, which add, I must say, nothing whatsoever, and just make the place feel more generic. <br>And furthermore (in an already small narrow bar), some genius decided that – LOL - let’s put a photobooth in here! A spectacularly rubbish idea. Clog up a bar where it’s already difficult to find a seat with a novelty that probably gets used ten times a week.<br>The first time ever, last month, I turned up and was struck that I didn’t actually desire to drink a single beer they were offering. <br>Imagine all this happening, and then being met with an almost tangible smugness at the bar as though they’re utterly convinced that their changes have made the bar the best place in town.<br>From characterful brown café to bellendy identikit craft ale bar in ten years, the metamorphosis is nearly complete.<br>Why then, is it included?<br>Sometimes you can be the harshest critic to your oldest friends. <br>Admittedly, there still are excellent ales to be had. The Belgian and German beers may have taken a back seat but haven’t gone away, and if you have £7 quid and rising to spare on a single beer, there are some difficult-to-find offerings in that chiller. They have also slightly improved their cask ale offerings which is hardly the point of the bar but generally worthy of praise.<br>Likewise, when it’s quiet, it’s still a nice place to be. North Bar’s best time of day is late-afternoon, early evening where it starts to get busier, but at a rate you barely notice while you’re sitting back and enjoying a beer. <br>I must use this opportunity to implore North Bar to take a look at what they were doing in the early 00’s and get back to that as soon as possible. We don’t need yet another craft ale bar, nor does North Bar warrant kookying up. North Bar was always best as a Belgian beer bar, with a great range of German beers, a simple brown café. You don’t get places like that very often in the UK. Why go from being different to being the same?",

This is definitely set up primarily for beer drinking. <br>A couple of casks, a couple of keg ales and a few lager options which are sold for a fair price, some of which represent relatively good value. The often variable in quality Staropramen is always kept here very well, while the new 4% lager Pravha and whichever blonde/pale ale they have on cask is usually sold cheaply.<br>Scanning across the room, you’ll find paintings from local artists (so far so café), a piano inviting you to play it, and some sturdy seating towards the back. If you carry on further, you’ll find a beer garden. Despite the bar being squished into a row of terraces they have done quite well to fashion this out of a tiny Victorian back yard. There isn’t much of a sun-facing window of opportunity out there, but during the summer you can enjoy a few hours out there.<br>Upstairs is a similar picture, with some mish-mash furniture and décor of a slightly twee nature, but not so much as to be genuinely upsetting. Rather out of character, there’s a big screen TV which selectively shows football and rugby games, meaning it is also a bit of a hidden gem if you’re looking for a less testosterone fuelled venue to watch a game.<br>Not long after opening, Wapentake has attracted a crowd who quickly liked what it was offering. While some of the affectations such as the artisinal bread and deli, and the slightly vanilla-twee décor may be irritating, it’s a great all-rounder and has often been the answer to the questions ‘where should we meet up?’ and ‘where should we go next?’",

It has a pool table, a dartboard, it does live sport, barbecues in the summer, pub quizzes, folk music, an extensive jukebox and has in the past offered free food to tempt people down. There are plenty of reasons to visit, and it’s a cosy venue too with properly upholstered seating and thick carpets.<br>The décor has always had the feel of needing a little bit of work, but all the same, it isn’t offensive.<br>You can expect cask ales at a decent price, kept well and sold at volume. Although they have at times had interesting bottles, the fridge options are a bit of a sideshow to the traditional fare on the taps.<br>Whether it’s to kill time, watch a game, enjoy the sunshine in the back garden, or pop down with a book, there always seems to be a reason to go to the Cobden. <br>At its best, the main lounge area to the right as you walk in is packed with students and rag tag locals (the local council has a strong showing for the Green party) who can get quite an atmosphere going in the evening. On folk music nights there is a collaborative and open feel, with no obligation to be quiet, which means at times the folk musicians win and at others the loud chat of the groups at around win. Being a part time contributor to the music, I can tell you from experience the quiet has to be earned with good playing (or crowd pleasing).<br>Sure, there are a few things here and there that would make the place even better, but the landlord works his socks off and is a generous guy. <br>It is one of those pubs where you only need to visit half a dozen times before you can name the regulars and the bar staff, and indeed it is the people that make it a special place, a genuine and vital community pub which needs your custom and goodwill.",

The new incarnation, Beer Engine supplies a surprisingly bright but nevertheless homely, simple pub wherein many great beers can be drunk.<br>The décor is minimalist to say the least, with huge chunky wooden tables of a light hue with plain whitewashed walls. The layout does well to make the space feel compact and pub like, with a couple of side rooms that work well for groups and especially if you need a more private space for plotting and suchlike.<br>The colour scheme makes it a good choice for a casual drink during the afternoon, and there is a beer garden out the back, but similarly when it turns to night time to place definitely turns on a full on pub feel.<br>The location ensures an interesting, mixed crowd, with London Road being a multicultural area, and fairly close to Sheffield United’s football ground, so there are always a few outlying folk ready to give this a try. Similarly, it seems to attract students from the nearby accommodation and cheaper rented properties up the road. As with a lot of Sheffield pubs you can guarantee an intergenerational blend soaking up the ale together.<br>With a name like Beer Engine, the pressure is on, and they don’t disappoint, with a good deal of cask ale, rotational keg beer from various more craft style breweries and a decent range of lagers and world beers should the inclination arise. The cask beer is well kept, and the bar is well staffed, meaning you get served good beer quickly – this seems to be one of the things they’re trying to deliver on.<br>With the clean décor and ‘newness’, even with the local crowd you never truly feel as though the pub has developed the kind of character where you’d say it was an institution, but reviews don’t lie. People come here because they really like it, and despite very healthy competition we recommend walking down the road from the centre to Beer Engine.",

Unfortunately these pubs seemed to be particularly vulnerable to the plague and pestilence brought about by brewery ownership, neglectful pubco’s and lowest common denominator pubgoing, that seemed to reach its nadir somewhere around the mid to late 90s.<br>Thankfully, in Yorkshire at least, the ‘real ale trail’ has seen a resurgence, partly due to a number of rail stations being located in beautiful Dales locations. It was these rural locations that were the last bastion of the quality station pub, but thankfully the network is growing, and the refurbishment of major rail stations has been seen as an opportunity to restablish the tradition in cities as well.<br>Sheffield Tap has done a great job of preserving the original features of the pub, with beautiful tiled walls, grand mirror panels stretching up to the ceiling and tastefully retrofitted wooden panels in some of the ante rooms. For a while, Sheffield Tap remained a modest size, but with capacity to expand, and this expansion has now taken place, opening out into two further rooms. Give them a go.<br>You can expect to pay a reasonable whack for the craft ales and exported beers, but not so much that you’ll regret it – they are still within the boundaries of fairness. Service tends to be lickety-split efficient as well. It’s a station so they realise many are there to have a drink and be on their way.<br>The backrooms have given the pub more room to breathe, so it is less hectic and business like in those backrooms if you wish to stay for longer. It still remains an odd venue to remain for hours, as looking out over the station platforms and never actually taking a train feels a bit weird. I find it works best when you’re looking to kill time.<br>As you’d expect, the naturally transient custom means there isn’t a cast of regulars in the pub, but the surroundings do give a sense of the former glory, which the brewing kit and the expanded space has somewhat resurrected. Even many of those glorious Victorian drinking parlours were there for a good time rather than a long time, and a visit to Sheffield Tap will suit this plan just fine. Grab one of their fantastic beers and recline, admiring the fixtures and fittings and enjoying the sound of conversation scattering in echoes along the tiles. (Added 2017)",

The Brothers would stand out a mile in most places, but unless you’re living in Heeley specifically, the array of other options makes it difficult to pick it out as a specific destination.<br>However, when joined on as part of a pub crawl to the nearby, and also excellent Sheaf View and the White Lion, you’ll find the excuse you’re looking for.<br>The pub is set up on a hill with a grand view over West Sheffield, and may initially throw you off, with the traditional signage for Ye Olde Shakespeare Inn large and undisturbed. It’s only when you get nearer you’ll see the modern, simpler (and to be honest, not great) renamed branding.<br>Worry not for the branding though, as the value to the pub lies inside. An unusual entrance to the pub involves you having to walk up a set of stairs to get to the main bar area. The pub may be out on a limb but that doesn’t stop the locals from flocking here in their droves as part of the aforementioned crawl.<br>Great cask ales, homeliness and simplicity is again the not-so-secret recipe for success. It’s difficult to see how so many pubs get it so wrong. Whether it’s nasty décor, capitulation to template chain pubs or just poor ownership, there seems to be a million and one diversions from what should be simple, reliable and successful principles governing good inn-keeping. When you visit the Brothers and sit yourself down in a cosy corner, have a game of darts, or prop up the bar with the rest of the throng, you’ll pull your hair out (if you have any left) wondering how people could get it so wrong.<br>Until you ingratiate yourself as a regular you might find the service sturdy and Northern rather than specifically friendly, which in a way typifies the feel of the pub, lying somewhere between working class boozer and friendly folksy tavern. I’m glad the balance doesn’t swing too far either way, as the pub is much the better for the variety of people it attracts – another thing the Sheffield pub scene excels at.<br>Southerners will be delighted at most of the beer prices, while similarly you might find some interesting European beers knocking about in here. The Brothers comes with a reputation for cheap ale that isn’t all that well deserved, but it’s far from offensive.<br>If you can wade through the luxury of other options in the city, or just happen to be in the area, the Brothers is another excellent and enjoyable place for a drink. The beer, the decor, the atmosphere, the amenities, the value. None of it can be faulted, and it fits comfortably and firmly in with the mission of our website.",

In one of Kotor’s tiny charming squares you’ll see a sign in Cyrillic indicating the above unwieldy name, as well the typical Niksicko insignia awning, with a few plain patio seats out front. You’ll also see another modern swanky bar adjacent, called Bokun. Looks quite Western-friendly and approachable doesn’t it? Shun that place, and head here for a true local experience.<br>You may already have deciphered, but this venue is a very informal club for retired sportsmen, or more accurately when you arrive, a Caffe Bar in the Dalmatian tradition, just with the generic attempts at modernity removed, but all the great aspects: the local character, the good value and the commitment to beer drinking amplified. <br>Instead of paying 3 euros for a large Niksicko, as is nearly standard elsewhere, grab a table out front or in the bar itself and order a bottle of Niksicko for half that price. <br>It’s pleasant outside in the sunshine but there’s a slice of local life to be enjoyed by diving inside in the evening, with a crappy old telly perched at the front of the room displaying the evening’s football, and a grand old trophy cabinet by the door displaying the club members’ various exploits in the 60s and 70s. <br>This may not sound like everyone’s idea of fun, but the gnarled elderly couple (probably 50 years old but looking worse for it) are friendly in their own Slavic way, and ordering a beer will produce an almost metronomically identical process. The master of ceremonies, in his tatty grey sweater ceases whatever he is doing, rather slowly assembles the bottles on a tray, and opens them in front of you one by one, in each case barking ‘Zvolite’ which appears to be Montenegrin for ‘voila’ or ‘cheers’, or a bit of both. <br>The crowd in KUZSIRIK (that acronym half works, though I doubt they call it that) are how you can image Kotor being minus the tourists. Some elderly folk clinging on to their spot in the old town, some labourers popping in for a morning/lunch/evening/last thing at night drink, the odd official and even the local constabulary, which certainly raised a few eyebrows from where we were sitting. Don’t expect them to speak much English or have much to do with you personally. They are happy you’re there seemingly; there is an understated appreciation about it all, but this is really their place for which you are their fleeting intruder. The busier the place is, the better.<br>As for the drinks offerings, Niksicko is far from the worst lager in the region, and stands up to a few pints, but pleasingly they have brought out an unfiltered version recently which boosts the flavour further, and stands up as a genuinely pleasant drink, albeit one that may become sickly after 5 or 6. The pleasure of paying a little over a pound for one of these (especially if you have arrived in Kotor from Dubrovnik, where value goes to die) will boost the experience further. Wine and Rakija is sold (the rakija is stored en masse in a big chest freezer) for pennies as well. Generally, finding a fairly specialist offering in such a gruff traditional place was a nice surprise. <br>There are some amusing eccentricities and oddities, for example over Easter each table had a saucer containing hard-boiled eggs for your enjoyment, that appeared to have been boiled in beetroot juice for good measure. There is an element of unabashed and unapologetic crapness about the way they make nearly no effort to market their existence, almost as though they’re actually trying not to be noticed too much. It’s quaint, if that’s not too patronising a word, to be in a bar where it isn’t primarily about making money.<br>Kotor experiences frequent afternoon thunderstorms, but being ‘stuck’ in a place like this while the square temporarily becomes a lake for two hours is no great shame, indeed it just gives you an excuse to turn around yet again and say ‘two please’. There are some nice spots in the centre of Kotor, but this is the only one with a genuine locals atmosphere, local prices and a memorable authenticity the Caffe Bars of Croatia and Montenegro seem almost pathologically incapable and distinterested in creating. Anyone going out for a beer and a chat in Kotor should be basing their entire evening around it.",

You won’t find many local haunts anywhere and finding even a simple crap lager for less than £3 close to impossible. <br>You may read blogs telling you how Dubrovnik being expensive is a myth, but that claim is now redundant. As a consequence of exchange rate changes, Game of Thrones tourism and the natural curve Dubrovnik and Croatia has enjoyed in general, the cat is well out of the bag. The old town is ruthlessly priced and research will lead you to places that sink in quality dramatically in the search for what are ultimately meagre savings. <br>The old town may have been hollowed out to cater for apartment dwellers and American backpackers but even so, the locals need a few places to relax. Libertina is hardly a shining example of good value or good beer, but fortunately it executes the main thing this sight exists to champion – it’s a really good atmospheric pub.<br>You’ll find Libertina stuck at the end of the uphill rabbit warrens at the north end of the old town, a slightly less visited corner, and one you might miss out on altogether if you weren’t to know about it. There’s an arched doorway and a rather pleasant semi-circular bar area patrolled by a kindly, rather simple sort of chap. The shape of the place invites communal drinking and you’ll quietly sing Hallelujah as you enjoy the environment of a true pub.<br>The place is decorated in a vaguely nautical theme, not overstated but enough to give it a traditional style. Libertina certainly isn’t interested in attracting the seen and be-seen crowd, and outside of the height of summer you’ll find the place largely filled with locals, which is a delight as a trip to Dubrovnik usually involves only interacting in a service capacity as the stand by the entrances to restaurants trying to attract your custom.<br>Libertina has a prime spot, with a raised seating area at the back of the room with cushions. It’s very cosy and snug, and if you make it there, you’re nearly all set for the evening. The downside is Ozujsko for £3 will slightly burn your pocked, but it’s difficult to do any better elsewhere in the city – you may as well pay it somewhere that’s good.<br>It’s one of the few places in the city that has a real hubbub and character, so despite the fact you can technically get better beer elsewhere (Glam Café for good beer but an otherwise generic experience) you’ll want to spend the wealth of your time in the evening in, Dubrovnik’s best pub.",

After a few days anyone interested in good beer and good pub going will be tearing their hair out (if they have any left) in frustration.<br>Sibenik’s nightlife offerings are in the main, no different. There’s a Riva with patio furniture so you can relax by the calm seas and people watch – fine for a while. When it gets colder and darker, venturing inside becomes necessary, and it is then where the particularly poor beer selection, poor music choices and absence of interesting décor or atmosphere starts to seriously grate.<br>Azimut is Sibenik’s alternative antidote to all that, a club and live music venue of sorts, with offbeat décor inspired by Hungarian ruin/garden bars making the most of its cellar situation nearly underneath the main square. As with a lot of places on the Croatian coast, it doesn’t really get going until the summer, but even out of season there is a core crowd you’ll find lining the bar chatting and messing around, and a side room which is geared up for live music but also has games involved. The eventual end feel is quite fun feeling and the sort of space you want to hang out in.<br>There’s what counts for an interesting selection of beers, with some English ales making an appearance, although sadly short on Croatian craft beer at the time of writing – only Tomislav was available, which is tasty but too strong to make a session on. The prices are a few kuna more than elsewhere, which is fine given the location, and not offensively dear. <br>You would think there would be a few places like this given young Croatians enjoy going out in the evening, and Sibenik is starting to attract the attention of Western tourists, but so far the nightlife seems depressingly obsessed with creating modern aspirational lifestyle bars to create that ‘summer vibe’, but ultimately blend in to one and project mediocrity and cheapness rather than glamour.<br>Hanging out in Azimut is a bit like breathing fresh air after all that. Quite some imagination and bravery obviously went into creating it, and any stay in Sibenik by anyone desiring a beer and a good time in the evening will involve a visit here.",

Valletta certainly knows how to make a beer drinking pubgoer concerned, as on an evening you may find what is otherwise a large old town to be boarded up and asleep in the manner of an English market town circa 1950 on a Sunday.<br>It’s vital to do some digging if you want to hang around all evening in Valletta, as turning up on spec could lead to a good hour of traipsing around fruitlessly for drinking options, something which can become more confusing on account of the inconsistent labelling of streets on printed maps flitting from Maltese to English whenever it feels like it. <br>Café Jubilee is a bit of a star in this void, a bar I’d be happy to visit were it in my town. The striking art nouveau decor and artwork makes it a very stylish and atmospheric place for a drink, regardless of how many people are there, yet it is actually a popular place with young people, and fills up in the evening. Grab any table you get the chance to. I’d say it goes past simply being tasteful and really crams in the art pieces to build a memorably busy-looking atmosphere.<br>There is an unavoidable café element to the place, as that’s the daytime purpose but I felt it transformed sufficiently on an evening to be a typical pub style meeting place, with a communal vibe developing that makes it feel more homely.<br>It’s also a place to find Farson’s Blue Label on tap, reasonably rare as most other places served only Cisk. The combination of cask bitter and the cosy, ornate surrounding are just the tonic to a pub scene otherwise lacking on a number of levels. Service and price are not notable, but neither are they offensive.<br>The good news is Café Jubilee are stationed in Gzira and Gozo too, providing further places of refuge as you try to navigate options that fall between tacky ex-pat bars and generic Mediterranean café terraces.",

All the evidence suggests there’s enough footfall for them to have made a pub three times as big and made a success out of it.<br>So at times, crowding around the bar is the only real option, but for much of the evening you should be able to grab a stool either at or opposite the bar and drink on the ledge. <br>The bar is only interested in serving small/medium sized Lithuanian ales, so there are some exciting options on tap, including a couple of dark lagers and Baltic porter which are essential on any trip to Lithuania.<br>The beer is great, though probably a little more expensive than most, but the best thing is the local, cosy feel. It’s designed to feel pub-like rather than stark and modern, and treads a fine line between that typical ‘craft beer pub look’ and a characterful venue.<br>You’ll find a nice range of people in here, the odd tourist, grumpy old men sharing space with excitable youngsters, sharing space with a business crowd, sharing space with couples having an intimate drink together. It’s a must-visit when you go to Vilnius.<br>The only downside is there is nowhere to sit down and relax, so although you may want to hang around, the stool seating just isn’t comfortable enough to want to spend your whole evening there, much as you may want to.

Despite the subterranean situation, there is a fairly high ceiling and the building itself has cellar windows dotted around the perimeter meaning plenty of light comes through from the outside, or at least just enough to make you feel like you aren’t in a bunker.<br>The bar’s decoration is all about retro ephemera, with panels and signs from the early 20th century, not only for beer but brands like Persil and Vim, which suit the place and help keep you occupied if you’re drinking solo. The furnishings are in good condition but have at least developed some age and character, and the choice of colour helps the place overall feel more like a pub than a bar. <br>I was drinking Svijany Maz, which at the time seemed like quite a good beer, but has rather fallen down the pecking order in subsequent years.<br>It wouldn’t be a Hostinec without some down and dirty food options so if the mood strikes you can order some pub grub or snacks for a very reasonable price. Meat, cheese, bread and beer, what more could you ask for?<br>While it may seem off the beaten track for a tourist, it seems everyone in the 18-45 age category knows the place well. The pub layout has bench seating across a network of different rooms so holds a surprising amount of people and even on a busy night you should find a seat somewhere. The place is clean and smells fresh, so hasn’t quite got the sheer raw appeal of a smoky Czech/Slovak pub, but it is a well designed, characterful and friendly pub that would almost certainly become a regular haunt upon residence in Bratislava.",

There are some good reasons why it has become a bit of an institution.<br><br>You’ll need to walk to the Raval district just a short walk west of La Rambla. This has been seen as an edgier district in the past but they seem to have cleaned it up, and while there may be some drunkards around late in the evening, and migrant workers trying desperately to sell you beer, it’s about as avoidable as the kind of contact you’d expect from almost every city centre.<br><br> The only thing to watch out for is being corned by any groups down streets you’re unsure of.<br>After a short walk the faded and stained net curtains and rather geriatric frontage of Marsella hoves into view. You might need to do a double take of which door panel to pull to enter, and it looks so delicate and aged that any mistreatment might damage the whole edifice.<br>This continues once you’re inside. <br><br>You’ll find a single-room bar with quite a wide space at the front doubling as part dance-floor part bar area. There probably won’t be any dancing going on when you arrive, and you’ll see most people gathered along the seating areas on the left of the room.<br>Take a moment to inspect the cracked plaster everywhere, the decrepit wood panelling and former grandeur, which brings to mind a Havana cocktail bar. There are shelves and bookcases along the far wall with bottles that look untouched for several decades.<br><br>Marsella is known for its absinth, and you may find some brave souls partaking in this dubious ritual as you scan the room, but far more of an astute decision would be to order one of their enormous and boozy cocktails that are made with panache but presented plainly and simply (contrast to any cocktail bar in England where the added value is all about the artifice and presentation). They may do beer as well, but only bottles.<br><br>It’s a double team with a master and apprentice. His teacher, a scholarly old soul who tends the bar and chips in here and there, and a young man who does the table service and most of the heavy lifting.<br><br>The atmosphere is powerful, but difficult to explain. I’d recommend plonking yourself on a table where you can see the bar area on your left and the seating area on your right, as this gives you the full panorama. There is a hell of a lot to look at in the bar, but don’t forget to take time to appreciate the general scene itself, where at points you will feel as if you’re fading into the history of the place.<br><br> Perhaps it’s the glow of the lights against the walnut-coloured wooden panels, or that undefinable ‘vibe’ that makes it an unforgettable destination, but the short of it is, they’ve created something simply by doing nothing. Since 1820 they’ve opened their doors and just let it gradually age (and in some senses rot) around them.<br><br>You can read the anecdotes about Hemingway, Picasso, Woody Allen if you like, but I preferred to sit there and considering the wider churn of people that must have frequented the place over time, mostly to enjoy the absinth and heady surroundings.<br>Places like this don’t come along every day.<br>",

No-one seems to have realised this indicates an as yet unfulfilled demand for a dedicated hospoda in central Cheb, which is another issue. Hang out by the bar and watch some footy on TV or just soak up the smokey and lively atmosphere. Everyone generally minds their own business but there’s a varied enough crowd to strike up a conversation.<br>Their best beer is Gambrinus Nefiltrovany, a much improved and frankly delicious option that’s sold for less than 30kc (ie. very good value). If Germans weren’t so parochial about their own beers they would be seething at paying over three times as much in such close proximity.There are a few other classic Czech beers to go at as well.<br>Being a pub restaurant, you may find it closing relatively early, which leaves you on a forlorn trail trying to find other drinking holes in Cheb (don’t give up – try the church). For what it is U Krale Jiriho does an excellent job and may even remind you quite a bit of traditional pubgoing in dear old Blighty.",

Lavished with money and tastefully designed, Moeder Lambic successfully elevated small-time lambic, sour and farmhouse ale brewed in Belgium and Northern France into the public consciousness, arguably quite some time before ‘craft ale’ took hold and claimed to do the same, and with a great deal more class and élan.<br>Stalingrad’s own branch of Moeder Lambic is less pub-like (Although with a refurbishment of Saint-Gilles, that is likely to become less true) with a long rectangular room, tall ceiling and lots of backlit dark grey stone and varnished wood everywhere. It’s a rather classy affair with a long bar gleaming with the various glasses and an impressive tap selection that seems to run the length of the bar.<br>Moeder Lambic offers a superb selection of 75cl bottles, versus the standard bottle sizes which are more modest, while the stuff on taps is often rare and high quality and these are what you are directed towards choosing. You pay for it, as the 25cl servings come for the price of a full sized beer elsewhere in Brussels (even in the centre), but there is at least a fairness about it when you visit. If you’re with a crowd you may find choosing one of the cheaper wine bottle sized beers slightly more affordable. Nevertheless, the prices are largely in line with high ABV% craft beer in England.<br>Moeder Lambic is one of those places where the servers have a confident swagger, and it does seem to pride itself on good customer service. There is a sense they are enjoying keeping the show on the road. This doesn’t always ring true during peak periods, but if you visit mid-late afternoon and order a good bottle, you can expect that brought out as if you were a VIP, gleaming bespoke glasses, tray of seeds to nibble, bottle places in a serving basked on a metal platter. Lots of this is just valueless ‘added value’, but it underlines that Moeder Lambic is an upscale treat. It’s a good sign to visit and see 2 of the same staff members year after year.<br>There are a few issues with Moeder Lambic. The bench layout is not condusive to a communal atmosphere, meaning it can feel more like a diner than a pub. The bar area gets overly crowded and you have to perch inbetween people talking to order, intrusive for them and awkward for me, something I really dislike doing. Their merchandise behind the bar is self-aggrandizing, cynical and laughably expensive – cult bars become cult all by themselves – trying to turn Moeder Lambic into a brand just smacks of BrewDog style commercialism.<br>Nevertheless, the thought of a holiday to Brussels without going for a beer at Moeder Lambic seems almost hollow. If you grab a seat while it’s getting gradually busier on an evening, the atmosphere seems to bubble up while the booze takes hold – and there is some truly great booze even by Belgian standards. It doesn’t matter that Moeder Lambic isn’t quite as good as it think it is, because the concept and the execution is classy and brings beer drinking up to a level of cocktail bars without doing so in a particularly pretentious way. <br>This is maintained by the crowd that visit, as it is still a frequently visited spot for Bruxelloise. During busy points in the evening they seem to make a point of turning up to grab the tables as if to exert their authority over the tourists.<br>A change in style from brown cafes and quirky pubs, Moeder Lambic is yet another essential feature of Brussels’ extraordinary tapestry of bars and beer.",

A great example of such a place is Hostinec U Rotundy in Prague, named after a dinky and rather out on a limb rotunda just 100 metres down the road, which acts as a handy waymarker for tracking this place down, a comfortable 10 minutes walk from the centre of the old town, and very close to the river.<br>The exterior is actually rather grand, even if the building itself looks rather ill-maintained, more of a Budapest type townhouse than a Prague one, especially when you take into account the knobbly grey-brown stone façade. <br>Wandering in, you are met almost immediately by the beer tap, with barely enough time to wipe your feet and take a measure of your surroundings. It’s an unusual setup but brutally efficient in some ways. Have a quick look at the beer offerings and voice your choice. <br>There are subtle class differences from bar to bar in Czech Republic which you can partly deduce from looking at the beer offerings. In Prague, Staropramen is largely available in the most working class pubs, if you don’t count their modern chain bar ‘Potrefena Hus’, which is reliable in a Wetherspoons kind of sense, but without the similar value for money. It is Staropramen which you’ll be ordering here. This beer is suffering a little from Carlsberg’s ownership, with some dodgy brewed under license operations across Europe which are dragging the quality down (try a Croatian Staropramen and feel true sympathy for the Croats) and trading on the label alone. However, despite that and the fact it so regularly doesn’t seem to be kept very well, there is a good beer there lurking in the background. U Rotundy is as good a place as any to try it in its best form. <br>The light 10 degree version is absurdly easy to wash down, and while you’re doing so, reacquaint yourself with the beer prices – 27 czech crowns…in Prague! You’re looking at one of the cheapest beers in the city in the Old Town district itself where a Pilsner Urquell is generally between 42-50 crowns these days. In current exchange rate terms this is under a pound a pint, even if you add on the extra 68ml that would bring a half litre to that point you’re getting a beer for under a pound in the old town of Prague, something which was apparently declared dead several years ago (when the exchange rate was far more favourable to the pound than it is now). Discoveries like this reinforce Prague’s reputation as a cheap beer mecca. <br>Now, a pub isn’t all about the beer and the price of it (though I’m sure some of the patrons of U Rotundy would probably argue otherwise), and a few of you may be feeling intrigued as to the place itself. I would liken it to a Czech equivalent of a Sam Smiths pub. The place is a throwback, probably even to Communist era Prague, and like many old fashioned pubs without music, there’s a calmness about the place only punctured by the occasional burst of laughter or if the sport is on telly. Although it doesn’t seem like the sort of place, they do serve food and if you read the reviews they are surprisingly good. It wouldn’t be my ideal locale to dine in, but when you need to line your stomach in preparation for several beers, why not streamline the experience, eh?<br>U Rotundy is the antithesis of glamourous, with its cheap beer and Staropramen insignia table cloths each thousands of times washed over, and is entirely geared up for the loyal custom of locals, engaged in volume drinking and happily accepting the transit custom of tourists like myself treating it as a living museum and gawping at the price labels. That said, it’s no soup kitchen or long dark airport lounge of the soul, this is a true pub in all senses, comfortable enough to lean back and relax, associate with your friends and acquaintances and have a chat. U Rotundy seemed to me missing that essential something that would propel it to the top of the ratings, and I think that was down to the cheap table cloths and slightly stark surroundings even for my tastes, but even then you’ll find the lack of concessions to modernity and absolute adherence to down and dirty drinking and smoking somewhat endearing, indeed a reflection of the national character. This is most typified by the fact they could sell their beer for 40% more and still receive plenty of custom, but choose not to, almost pride themselves on their reluctance to raise the price. Pubs like that are always loveable because they give you the sense the owners are on a similar wavelength to yourself. <br>It’s the kind of place that will make a certain percentage of people throw their nose in their air and squeal in discomfort. For the rest of us, there is a simple no-nonsense pub with efficient service, local character and outstandingly cheap good beer, so much so that considering all factors I would lay it out on the line as the best relative value beer I have ever had.",

It’s an interesting literally bohemian bunker of different rooms and moods, somewhere between a bar and a club.<br>First things first: A strange payment system that may initially send off the wrong signals. You rent a fob for 50kc, which is then used inside to pay for beer. You’ll note the server becoming irate as for the zillionth time they ask a clueless newcomer to blam their fob against the not very well signposted counting machine at the bar. After your time in the bunker you emerge at the top to settle up your account with the doorman. Sounds dodgy as anything, but I can confirm no swindling or funny business goes on, and the guy at the top is reasonably easy going.<br>Once you’re over that initially strange faff you can concentrate on drinking and having a good time. The bars are stocked with 6 or 7 interesting Czech beers on tap. Yes, bars plural, this venue holds quite a web of different rooms, and it’s worth having a good walk around to explore where you’d prefer to hang out. One room looks like the galley of a ship, another is a very compact little music venue, there are maze like corridors, stairs up to balconies and down into basements, and every now and then a dog passes doing laps of the place.<br>It’s a nice reminder that Prague, just like Budapest and Krakow does have a good underground scene, it’s just so buried under high quality regular pubs that you occasionally have to remind yourself to partake in it. <br>It’s quite obviously a bit of a hipster/alt-crowd hangout for twenty somethings, but there’s enough space to choose how you want to hang out, whether that’s finding a snug corner, or reclining with some of the dropouts, or enjoying the live music. There’s plenty to do, and despite the fact beer is served in bloody jam jars, even that cannot prevent this strong recommendation. <br>A: 9/10 B: 10/10 C: 9/10 D: 8/10 E: 8/10 F: 8/10",

Wooden floor, wooden ceiling, wooden ledges, wooden barrels, wooden seats, wooden bar. King Grizzly is like the spit and sawdust bars of old, if you took special care to remove both title elements from the equation.<br><br>Being slap bang in the centre of Florence doesn’t yet appear to have rendered King Grizzly either overcrowded or overpriced, and it may be something to do with the ostentatiously growly fuzzy bear appearance. Those upturned barrels probably put half the Aperol Spritz crowd off, while the exterior has a certain anonymous look that you could walk past it a dozen times before noticing it properly.<br><br>What this means in reality is that anyone in the vicinity who is after a real pub experience and a good beer can enjoy both of those in comfort without struggling for seating room or access to the bar. The personification of King Grizzly seems to be the chap behind the bar, one of those bearded sorts where the beard makes him look wise beyond his years. Affable, helpful, and unlike nearly all Italian bars and restaurants he will give you a glass of tap water (many places claim it’s illegal to serve tap water to customers) rather than charging you for mineral water. Mr Grizzly can guide you to a beer that you’ll like, which was particularly useful as my girlfriend is still struggling to get into beer. An Italian double-wit beer and a salty Germanic Gose later, and it feels like we might be making progress!<br><br>Yes, this is a craft beer place, in that most of the offerings are from the ‘craft scene’ as it were, rather than traditional breweries, and are priced accordingly. However, none of the prices should scare off any English tourists who these days are used to spending £5+ upwards on terrible lager elsewhere, and when you put it into context, the prices are perfectly reasonable considering the excellent quality. If you ever needed persuading that Italian beer is getting its act together, you will leave this pub converted. <br>It’s one of those places where you can say you met as strangers and left as friends. A great example of how a good pub and a good beer can bring people together. So good that a place like this can be directly in the old town of Florence. The Grizzly King: A Romance of the Wild.",

Meanwhile, the going underfoot lurches from ice rink to quagmire with each step. Checking to your right for the cyclist that probably isn’t there (but inevitably will break your arm the one time you don’t bother checking) – and then left to see if any motorists fancy testing how well their airbags work. Each movement of your leg invites a splash of freezing sludge and fresh test of your balance.<br><br>Across the roundabout we spot a window glowing like a beacon, heat from the room condensing on the glass, the silhouette of drinkers and the sound of good cheer – it’s a pub – rarely has there been a more fine or welcome sight.<br><br>Shuffling precariously across the ice I spot the sign above the bar confirming the establishment and nothing can stop us now. While there isn’t video evidence to prove otherwise, you may take my word for it, I’ve never homed in on an Amstel sign with such vigour and enthusiasm.<br><br>Amsterdam is well-used to this appallingly unpleasant weather and therefore well-prepared in its provision of shelter and booze. In late spring and summer Café Mulder flings open its doors and spreads out into the street front, but on a night like tonight this traditional brasserie turns into a refuge.<br><br>Being hugged, wrapped in a fresh towel and ushered inside would be the ideal welcome, but the blast of warmth and prospect of a stiff drink ably substitutes.<br><br>The pub was as busy as it looked from the outside, full of folk relieved indeed to be anywhere except outside. Now, ensconced among a mixture of regulars and tourists, a drink and a chat will do the trick very nicely.<br><br>Seeing an Amstel sign would normally be a bad omen, but their sickly dross is ubiquitous in the city and it’s genuinely more difficult to find such a place that doesn’t also serve other, better beer. So, here you can choose between a pint of that insipid liquid or a smaller portion of something far nicer for the same price.<br><br>Outside of craft beer enthusiasts perhaps, it’s difficult to think that beer drinkers could be too upset by the selections here, especially as the place isn’t wholly beer-focused. The likes of Brugse Zot and De Koninck on tap, and at least 7 or 8 genuinely good bottles provide a stock that, while it could be better in variation and sizes, covers several bases well and isn’t going to let too many people down.<br><br>It’s nice to see that the place provides a small selection of food rather than turning itself into a dining room, so if you fancy wolfing down some soup, toasties or bitterballen (I wouldn’t blame you in weather like this) get involved. You can even get a hot boiled egg – very old fashioned and it doesn’t take away from the pub feel.<br><br>There’s a bit of extra character too with a pub cat and you’ll note it claims to be “the most authentic pub in Amsterdam“. A bold claim (not one it backs up in any way) but this is really for you to explore and see for yourself.<br><br>Ronald Pattinson of European Beer Guide fame – a man worth listening to about Dutch brown cafés – commented:<br><br>“I’m still regularly pleasantly surprised by Amsterdam’s pub scene. While simple, unpretentious cafés like this survive in such numbers, I’ll pass on the razor blades.”<br><br>Mulder fits into the brown café aesthetic beloved of the Low Countries but has a hint of the French brasserie to my eyes, with enormous windows and a more classically corner bar layout. The pub-like elements come from an impressively ornate bar area and shelf unit, the stylish old décor, rustic furniture and the type of socialising going on within, which certainly on a bitter night swings towards the communal. The sense of history helps too, with a lot of features looking turn of the 20th century.<br><br>London is blessed to have a huge number of pubs in the same way Amsterdam does, of a variety as-good-as-duplicated many times over. However, with a few exceptions, many of these London pubs have been made more generic by unimaginative owners or pub-companies, the scourge of character and identity. In London, I suspect this place would have gone the way of Nicholsons or Taylor Walker in the last decade and had its soul expunged, but pleasingly, one of the nicest things to say about Café Mulder is that it is not unique, it is not an oasis surrounded by a desert, but it’s common, frequent to find and that’s what makes Amsterdam still so thoroughly enjoyable. We should celebrate the fact that a place this good is only a notch above the mean average for a brown café in Amsterdam. Is this the inverse of damning with faint praise? I hope so.<br><br>Anyway, to boil it down, Mulder is a great place to go for a drink, and you know what? I managed to write all that without a single X-Files joke.

You could decide on a trip out if the weather’s nice, but when they’ve set up what is ostensibly their Prague tap house in one of the nicest old pubs in the city centre, there’s a convenient excuse to stay put.<br><br>I urge you to mark this pub on your map of Prague as this area of the city between Josefov district and Florenc metro is a little short on pubs worth a damn. I often find myself having to head through it, and invariably choose this place as the pub of choice.<br><br>The difficulty is, once you move east from the old town (let’s say, from U Parlamentu/U Pivnrce) area and through Josefov, the traditional Czech pubs disappear and are replaced by cocktail bars and glamorous-looking (but probably seedy) ‘gentlemen’s’ clubs. Josefov is a fascinating district for many reasons but purely on pub terms, I wouldn’t get your hopes up. This malaise extends past the Powder Tower and the Štefánikův bridge to be honest, all the way into Karlin. With one notable exception.<br><br>For traditional Czech drinking (the kind where you’ll be rubbing shoulders with normal Prague folk while chugging pivo) the newly christened Hostomická Nalévárna is the best option in that half-mile radius. If you’re planning a pub crawl, particularly if you’re staying near Náměstí Republiky this place will be a godsend to help join the dots together. In fairness, it isn’t a long walk from the old town anyway.<br><br>Pivovar Hostomice has a great reputation for their beer, which is handy given there aren’t any beers from other breweries available at this pub. From the several visits I made they offered an unfiltered 10° světlé výčepní (light lager), 12° světlý ležák (premium lager) and a 13° tmavy, (or dark) lager on tap as a general rule. They may have specials on rotation but if they do, they weren’t exactly advertising the fact. I’m just glad when I visited in March, no-one was drinking green beer, (brewed every Easter and bafflingly popular, even among locals).<br><br>Their prices are a steal considering it’s Prague city centre,  his good value extends to the other options available, such as the wine (which my partner found almost as cheap as beer elsewhere around the city).<br><br>One of the more intimidating things for a tourist, leaving the traditionally large pivnices in Prague city centre behind and heading to a local drop-in pub is the more direct interaction with locals, and this is something you’ll need to factor in during your visit. Knowing your p’s and q’s goes a fair way in Czechia. The tapster here is a polite enough young man who will speak in Czech if he thinks he can get away with it but is hospitable to outlanders who play by the house rules. He serves as both tapster and server given the small size of the place. At the very bare minimum, muttering ‘dvyeh piva prosim’ will procure two of their light beers. Fresh, unfiltered and delicious, I may say. The unfussy branding and lack of a corporate feel reminded me of the often brandless, but out of this world fresh Kellerbier and Vollbier you can find in Franconia and Bavaria.<br><br>Moving onto the pub itself, it’s a small cosy sort of place with a small bar on your left as you walk in, and a compact seating area in behind. Click here for a quick slideshow from the brewery’s facebook account. I managed to be seated on each occasion I visited which seemed unlikely given the place seats perhaps 25 people at most, and is never empty. The amount of wood you’re surrounded with is typical of these kind of places, and a look I enjoy very much, even if I do wish they offered cushioned, upholstered seats like most English pubs.<br><br>The folk around you vary from quiet couples in their 30s",

All too often a pub’s history is used as a fig leaf to disguise the fact the interior has since been vandalised and transformed into a chain-operated place devoid of character. A lot of pubs run a pub quiz, food nights, karaoke, live music but are thoroughly unappealing nonetheless. That’s no magic bullet.<br><br>It takes a degree of resolve these days to run a pub that doesn’t bother with half of that, isn’t trying to be anything it’s not, doesn’t care about mythologising, widening demographics, or trying to get each customer to pay the absolute limit of what they’re prepared to.<br><br>It would be tempting to call such a place ‘quaint’ but there is a patronising element to that word, bordering on ignorant, which I dislike, and which Briody’s doesn’t deserve. I didn’t think Briody’s the least bit ‘quaint’ on my visit. It is however a simple honest boozer that has thought about what to improve,what to keep and what to maintain very carefully.<br><br> <br><br> <br>I like the small size – you have a small lounge area on your left, in front of a bar stretching along the room, with comfortable upholstered bench seats lining the wall. It is as big as it ever needs to be, and has a degree of cosiness without ladling it on too thick. It’s a nice lounge, your living room with a bar and a few other folk in it, essentially. Perfect for quiet contemplation, reading, good conversation and so on. There’s an upstairs which I understand is for hire for students cramming for exams, meetings and so forth.<br><br>One thing you can never tell from the outside of an Irish pub is how good it’s going to be once you walk in. Nearly all of their exteriors have a rather studied look, with the ubiquitous Gaelic script, or at least a typeface aged enough to suggest a traditional interior. However, this often has little to do with what you’re presented with when you walk in, and it takes a keen eye to distinguish your plastic paddy pub from the genuine places frequented by locals.<br><br>One commonality in Dublin, is the sight of a ruddy-cheeked, broad-chested man of borderline retirement age doing the serving, usually dressed very smartly in a plain Daz-white shirt, black trousers and shiny shoes and belt. There’s a certain formality to this which conveys command. Maybe not wholly consciously, but I believe that’s intentional.<br><br>These fellows are usually quick-witted and not short of a few comments to make, especially if they haven’t seen your face around their pub before. It’s usually jovial jesting at most, and you’ll notice the standard of welcome in Dublin a notch higher than most European cities, apart from perhaps the most tourist-ridden places where the demand on the service and the churn of staff makes that difficult.<br><br>No such worries at Briody’s – taking a seat there feels like you are being added to a painting. Here’s where you find your more raw Dubliner accent, blue language aimed at the Gaelic footy on TV, and most thankfully, an excellent pint of Guinness. You know you’re in for a good pint of the stuff when the cream on top forms an almost-film like layer when it settles. It’s not cheap in Ireland these days, but a pint is cheaper in Briody’s than many places elsewhere in the city centre. Anything like that is welcome on the wallet.<br><br>This explains why locals head down here (many of whom the bar staff know by name) but there are other factors. Despite being 5 minutes walk from the Spire on O’Connell Street, most locals don’t venture down Marlborough Street running parallel, instead sticking to and clogging up the main arteries of the city. Given other areas of the city are studded with pubs – mediocre ones – all of which are crammed full, it’s a strange feeling that somewhere like Briody’s could plough its own calm furrow, almost hiding in plain sight.<br><br>https://www.dublinbypub.ie/pubs/briodys-marlborough-st/<br><br>“Setting foot in the pub, you immediately feel like you are on familiar territory. Just like wandering into your grannies, you know you’re in good hands. The interior is typical of a good local boozer; tiled flooring greets feet upon entrance before a pristine carpet overtakes the rest of the floor space. Lighter wooden tones are well complimented with beige embossed wallpaper. The seating proved to be tremendously cosy in its simplicity while classic drink brands and sport are the themes exhibited in frames upon the wall. We took a particular shine to a bittersweet portrait of Paul McGrath seen in his heyday sitting at an unidentified bar holding a creamy pint aloft.”<br><br>It is one of those pubs that you wouldn’t see what the fuss was about until you’d spent a good while visiting the so great many mediocre ones first.<br><br>Comfortable, authentic, friendly, and simple. That’s the way it is, and the way it wants to stay. Perhaps deep down they may not welcome me saying this, as this is their refuge rather than a tourist hub, but here we are. I can’t ignore you.",

It’s a remarkable feat that places it as one of London’s core heritage pubs.<br><br>Many pubs trade on their history, (and that of The Seven Stars is an interesting read) , without backing that up by being an enjoyable place to drink in the here and now. Thankfully, The Seven Stars is not one of those places: it’s a little cracker.<br><br>Carey Street has a row of townhouses that are overshadowed by the enormous London County Court, Royal Courts of Justice and LSE library, so it is quite easy to wander halfway past The Seven Stars before realising. It’s a very quiet street and doesn’t seem the most likely place for a pub to be situated these days, though that makes it a perfect venue for those in-the-know. The frontage of The Seven Stars is squat and compact with the predictable (but entirely appropriate) gothic signage. It looks like a small place and it is – there’s no TARDIS effect once you walk inside.<br><br>Although micro-pubs may now be reversing the trend for enormous, open plan pubs, none of them are made quite like this old thing. You’ll walk through the entrance to find a low-beamed venerable establishment with a bar directly opposite the entrance, and a narrow space set over two rooms. There are stools to sit at the bar and drink, and tables decorated with checked tablecloths and candles (a little dressy for my tastes, but it did make me think fondly of Den Turk in Ghent, which is not dissimilar).<br><br>For the last decade or so, The Seven Stars has been the domain of a ruff-sporting and locally famous pub cat who sadly passed away not so long back. Nevertheless, I have been informed a new cat has entered the premises! If you venture into conversation at the bar with the owner Roxy, she may expand on the and possibly get into the tale of one punter who mistook the cat bowl for bar snacks. Don’t be shocked – anything can happen in London.<br><br>The décor and ‘lived-in’ nature of the pub is where most of its character comes from, a pleasingly ungentrified and carefully preserved sense of welcome that tends to strike an immediately positive impression with people regardless of any preconceived ideas. This impression is important to cling onto for when you order a beer (or food), because those London prices hit hard and hit deep. This isn’t worth singling The Seven Stars out for, however, that’s just how things are. It is worth bearing in mind a lot of lawyers drink here.<br><br>Nevertheless, you’ll find a set of well kept cask ales from regional breweries served via hand pump – it’s a decent if unspectacular range which will keep you satisfied for at least a few.<br><br>In a similar way to Whitelock’s in Leeds, the toilets are located above the pub itself via a satisfyingly creaky staircase, where you will also pass by the kitchens and a room crammed full of odds and ends. By any standards these days (particularly London’s), this is a characterful and individual place that isn’t interesting in the Farrow & Ball school of interior design or repainting itself to remain ‘on-trend’ every ten years.<br><br>As mentioned above, the pub is popular with local lawyers and court staff, and due to the small size you may find yourself unable to grab a seat. However, trade is brisk in the evenings so be patient and things will move along – grab your chance when you see it. There’s nothing like being seated to enjoy the atmosphere of a tangle at the bar in a traditional pub such as this.<br><br>As the lights from the outside dim, and those from the inside take over, there can be no question of whether this is a pub of outstanding merit.<br><br>Although The Seven Stars may have lasted 400 years, the obnoxious pace of gentrification in the last 30 years means that pubs like these perpetually under threat from people who simply want to run poor facsimiles of bars they’ve seen elsewhere. This is a pub that demonstrates the importance of being your own thing. That’s worth something.<br><br>I’ll leave you with this anecdote from their website:<br><br>“While enjoying a few Friday afternoon wind-down drinks, a group of 15 or so lawyers (young ones) entered the Seven Stars awkwardly and decamped nearby. There then began a cacophonous symphony of table and chair scraping, until they had blocked all passage in or out of the bar. Regaling of a most competitive flavour followed, ever louder, underwritten by a desperate, pleading “notice me” subtext. Its volume only matched by the ethereal transparency of its content. We drank up and moved on – our seats snatched hungrily into their possession before we got to the door. Congratulations, you’ve emptied the pub! Not all lawyers are like this, true, but this was selfish and shameful behaviour. Hopefully, few noticed.”",

Not to dampen the fires too much, but I think it would be best if I was realistic about the good – and the bad – aspects of U Zlateho Tygra.<br>The good stuff first – the design and layout is an archetypal Czech pub with wooden tables and panels along the wall, curved cream-coloured walls and the odd framed photograph touching on most of the key themes of the pub – tigers, literary figures and Pilsner Urquell. You’ll find a tapster working the taps almost non-stop. At some quieter places the tapster can be at a loose end but this is one of those places that is so busy it looks like extremely hard work.<br>The beer itself is a standard, non-mickey taking price when you consider the old town mean average and arrives without your say so, as does a second and a third (unless you make a point of putting the mat over your drink). If you turn up thirsty you could easily find yourself processing several Pilsners in short order. <br>There’s a gregarious excitable atmosphere inside, and it really does feel like the place to be.<br>Now the bad stuff. You may or may not be aware that Czech pubs allow reservations, meaning turning up at some places on spec can result in disappointment. At U Zlateho Tygra you may as well forget even trying to turn up in the evening unless you have reserved your spot in advance. When you get in it will feel like a private member’s club where you need to stay all evening to get full value for the exclusivety. Don’t despair though, as there is a way in. Turn up at 2.50pm, join the queue, and if you’re in the front 30 or so you should be assured of a seat unless you’re in a large group. If you see people pushing in at the front then choose whatever retribution you see fit.<br>This may not be a concern for you, but I feel a duty to point out that U Zlateho Tygra’s main appeal is that of a minimalist down-to-earth Czech pub. That down-to-earth feel is detracted from when you queue up to get in then upon entering find yourself boozing among multinationals. And for those expecting anything spectacular in terms of décor, they may be even further disappointed, as even though there is some nice stained glass and a sturdy venerable feel, it’s hardly La Sagrada Familia. <br>In order to have the best time at U Zlateho Tygra, work out when you’d prefer to go, and if that’s after 3.15pm book a table in advance. Come for a flavour of Czech drinking at its best, and try not to focus too much on the externalities. You’re here for a good time, and everyone else is. Don’t expect much from the server other than a conveyor belt of Pilsner Urquell and a food order.<br>It’s not somewhere I would choose to go every week and there are places to go for a similar experience without the hype and tourism, but there’s no doubt it has a certain sprinkling of magic, and unlike me you may be lucky enough to try it on different dates and times of day to work out when to absorb the most local flavour. As hackneyed as it is to say, you can’t really miss out this pub.",

They even claim to be the first bar offering cask ale in Europe, which is patently rubbish, but nevertheless is a welcome acknowledgement of the quality of cask brewing, sometimes overlooked by keg obsessed craft brewers.<br>As with many ruin pubs the place has a great number of amenities and is so open plan and relaxed you can make more or less anything socially you want out of it. Lunch spot? Yes. Relax with a book. Yes. Beer tastings at the bar? Yes. Live sports? Yes. Club. Yes. <br>There are certain places that try and combine these things horrendously unsuccessfully, so I hope I can allay your fears in this respect. Each utility has its own place, and its unlikely you will ever feel any aspect of the place oppressive.<br>The painted black industrial feel works well combined with the greenery, and although it is nowhere near as unique and quirky as many ruin pubs, on a hot day you can nosey around the various interesting hidey holes and side-rooms well into the evening. <br>The crowd in Eleszto is a combination of hardcore beer geeks and hostel-based backpackers, a young and largely friendly crowd. Eleszto is not in the core ruin pub area either so it does require a very short tram or metro ride. The area is also up and coming for bars and pubs so it isn’t out on a limb by any means.<br>Much like Poland, Hungary is among the countries where you can obtain very full flavoured craft ale on the cheap, and Eleszto goes quite some way towards flaunting Hungary’s current wares. There is a way to go but it’s just encouraging to know they’ve finally had enough of Borsodi and Dreher and doing something about it.<br>The good thing about Eleszto is, you can fit it in with your own plans, safe in the knowledge that there’s no particular time to go, it’s always a good time to go. If it wasn’t in Budapest it would be nearly every other city’s number one or two bar.",

The main bar area is a little unusual with full length glass windows overlooking an arcade – a trifle too modern and hasn’t done well with their attempt to give it character - but the backroom is an absolutely classic example of a Czech pub, with a curved pivnice type ceiling, plenty of communal tables and the sense of history reverberating through the echoes of friendly conversation. <br>The server is fairly efficient considering the space in the pub, meaning you can expect swift refills at all but the busiest times, and being in Brno, the beer itself is dirt cheap, and will barely bust 30 koruna.<br>It’s the kind of pub you would make your local minutes after moving into town.

Even when they adopt a certain style, their wood has not yet aged or warped, their furniture still smells newly crafted and varnished and the walls and beams are still clear of the accumulation of odds and ends inherited over the years. It’s difficult to get a local crowd kick started when everything feels clean and sterilised.<br>Often the reaction to this is to change the style – go modern – and in doing so create a place that works from the word go. However, there is the riskier niche, to simply build a cheap DIY venue and pray that people turn up.<br>U Alberta is an example of the latter, and is hugely popular. The pub is in an odd place, which itself may help it stand out, being in what looks like a hut on the footpath up to Spilberk Castle. There are not too many obvious signs of its whereabouts leaving you to chance your arm.<br>When I arrived most tables were full, leaving only a space at the bar. The bar area itself was very rudimentary, and the barman was struggling between servicing sandwich orders and tapping off various ales. <br>U Alberta prizes itself on the quality and locality of the beer, and has a part in Brno’s growing craft ale scene. This is one area of Czech Republic where the larger breweries don’t hold as much sway, and the locals, including the university crowd have happily got into drinking beer from craft and regional brewers. This means more variety of styles and sometimes higher quality of beers.<br>The place had a terrific atmosphere, being largely twenty-somethings in diverse groups, sitting around in friendly bunches, with a fire going around the side of the room. The main quality I could describe this as is very unpretentious, which given you’re talking about students and the young is quite a commendation.<br>I got talking to a local member of Pivni (similar to CAMRA) about the scene in Brno and had a very friendly evening here. I would like to think over time they would make a few changes here and there to make it feel a tad more homely and less like it was half-finished, but other than that, I can’t fault it and would strongly urge anyone in Brno to pay a visit.

If you weren’t on holiday and simply needed a place to slowly recline and dissolve into, you could hardly make a better choice than this pub.<br><br>As referenced above, this is not as touristy a place, although it does receive a few keen travellers such as myself, and there appears to be a couple of hostels nearby so the crowd is a healthy mixture of both locals and people enjoying it for their first time.<br><br>Due to the new association with Verschueren, the beers have been revamped, a genuinely excellent selection at perfectly reasonable prices, elevating the place to a near mythical level.",

There aren’t any tacky cheap St. George’s flags, and there isn’t a fruit machine. There’s no tacky Wetherspoons type details carpet or upholstered seats. Yes, they serve fish and chips and they have a pub quiz, but both of those are arguably good things by themselves. They have chosen to recreate a stripped back and elegant corner bar akin to a coastal corner pub in south of England.

If it’s dark they will seemingly keep on serving. I couldn’t imagine visiting the bar any other time than very late in the evening, as walking in past the rows of couples dripping sweet nothings by murky candle light, and groups of young folk plotting in the nooks and crannies of the bar is never better than at some unholy late time of night. Every visit seems to end with the bar being at least as busy as when you entered, it seems like it will never really close.<br>Unfortunately the pub only offers slightly last-gen beer offerings, with the Zywiec range on tap, at a locally uncompetitive price, but that weakness aside, there’s very little else to mark the bar down for. The range of rooms and seating allow groups to have the kind of evening they want. There are intimate tables for two, communal pub type seating, sofas and of course the garden space.<br>Every city needs a go-to place for a late drink and this is definitely one of the greatest at that task.

Today, the Ratskeller ‘Spiz’ delivers to modern Poland an authentic enough representation of the style, and acts as an anchor in the city’s social scene.<br>Importantly too, Spiz has its own brewery, competing with two other breweries based on the square itself. All their brewers are unfiltered and unpasteurised giving them a hard-to-match freshness, and the whole range from the light lagers, yeast beer and honey mead are somewhere between good and very good. They are geared towards either hearty winter drinking or refreshing high volume session drinking and hit the mark exactly.<br>Along with the Germanic, gothic and stately subterranean beer hall with its impressive mash tuns, giant barrels, cloistered ceiling and interesting display cabinets, there is a huge seating area outside, which on a sunny day becomes the ultimate drinking spot, as one can recline and enjoy the sights and sounds of a buzzing and vibrant Rynek. To your left, the clock tower of the Ratusz, straight ahead the magnificently restored burgher houses, and to your right the join onto the Maly Rynek. <br>A passion for preserved historical features isn’t just borne of an interest and preference in historical architecture, but a yearning for the atmosphere and simplicity of the time. Sat outside spectating on the various forms of life passing by does on a temporal level transport you to a previous era. The Rynek is terrific and Spiz has the number one location for enjoying it.<br>If there wasn’t anything to do in Wroclaw it would be enjoyable in itself to spend your entire time at Spiz. As can be seen by the various reviews, the positive experiences are well founded.<br>Yes, it’s entirely obvious as a destination and not ‘alternative’ in the slightest. The service may not be all that, and it can be very busy. Similarly, the TV screens downstairs in the beer hall garishly advertising info about its horrendous looking disco nights detract from the experience. It needs to be very very good to overcome these – and it is. (Added 2017)",

The venue itself is traditional in style, and theatrical in shape with raised seating around the perimeter of the ‘pit’ area in front of the bar. <br>Drinks are best procured from the bar area as table service and can be a little slow at peak times.

Going for a night out in Palma generally revolves around tapas bars, often lively and buzzing but lacking any really loveable venues. Indeed, the noise, constant eating and paucity of good beer becomes a drawback after a time.<br>Thankfully Lorien has stepped into the breach, a superb genuine beer pub with a thankfully loose Lord of The Rings theme (think tastefully framed artwork rather than costumes). The pub tailors for an audience starved of choice and quality, with a range of Spanish and Mallorcan craft ales on tap. This will come as a refreshing change of speed from the relentlessly uniform options of Estrella or Mahou everywhere else in the city.<br><br>There is a corresponding uptick in price which is hardly surprising given the sheer lack of competition, but given the alternative option is standing around food-munching Mallorcans in corporate tapas bars, or drinking wine in inappropriately intimate cellar bars, it’s worth it.<br>Furthermore, Lorien succeeds by being a real pub. There is bench seating and a square communally facing main room, and unsurprisingly a rather different crowd of young people dressed informally in a cosy and informal setting.<br>The bar staff are almost textbook beer monsters, bald, big beards and big beer guts, and are more than happy to chew over your drinking options. Thankfully Lorien strikes the balance right between the studious beer contemplation and a friendly communal feel.<br>Anyone dying for a good beer and a communal pub in Palma should come here.

The best rooms are undoubtedly the ground floor and first floor, whereas the loft feels more like an overflow area.<br>Atmosphere/Character: Popular venue and the worst kept secret 'hidden bar' in the country. A good range of ages visit which gives the place a sociable democratic feel. Service is decent given the tourist churn. A place one could find themselves drinking in all afternoon.<br>Amenities/Events: Small selection of food, tasting trays, multiple floors.<br>Value For Money: Higher than normal for the area.<br>description: Reading old blogs, you’d think the destination of this bar was a mystery, or that the existence of side alleys was. However difficult to find people seem to think De Garre is, that doesn’t seem to stop it being full half an hour after opening and all day until closing.<br>Its popularity is based on the charm of the place. The side alley location certainly lends it a bit of character, with crumbling whitewashed brickwork draped with ivy branches and an uneven, typically Bruges set of cobblestones underfoot. The property is extremely old, and the staircase and floorboards are wonky and uneven, which may seem almost kitsch but Bruges is old and crooked enough a city to make it congruous.<br>The pub is set on 3 storeys, and each sort of feel like their own internal habitat. I like the idea of pubs set on several floors but sometimes you can end up on the least desirable one. The higher up you go, the more uneven steps you must take, so if you turn up worse for wear, have a quick think how sensible that is.<br>One of the pubs little specialities is its own house beer, a formidable Tripel called De Garre, weighing in at nearly barley wine strength and served with a side-plate of gouda to wash it down with. The De Garre is brewed by Van Steenberge off-site but it’s still nice to see a house beer that’s actually interesting and unique rather than a rebadged lager or pale ale.<br>The genteel nature of the pub means it attracts elderly custom, who don’t appear to consider the uneven angles, steps and low hanging beams a threat to their existence. During the day the place has much more of a café feel as a consequence, so you might want to consider whether that’s your sort of thing. However, finding a nice table and position somewhere, chatting along in your own little world is often just as enjoyable, and it does get more pub-like and atmospheric in the evening.<br>It’s a very popular place so time your visit wisely, and if that doesn’t work, persist, it’s located in the centre and easy to pop back for another try.",

There’s the impression Le Coq sits on some prime real estate but stubbornly refuses to be pushed out onto the fringes.<br>At the time of writing the pub remains almost off-grid in terms of its online presence, even in terms of user-generated content which is very odd given the hundreds of patrons that pile through its doors every day in search of moody refreshment. Therefore it is difficult to provide much visually, and I wished I had taken the opportunity in my last visit.<br>The brown café involves a mixture of seductive atmospheric drinking and something more solid, a plain matter-of-factness stripping away some of the ephemera and fripperies other pubs go in for. On the one hand, there is an element of the humdrum and workaday about a brown café – the typical working class drinks offerings on tap, Stella, Hoegaarden and Leffe, the sound of simple bar stools and pub furniture scraping across tiled floors, the head-space offered by the tracks of time inbetween music playing. On the one hand the browns, the crimsons and the lighting slowly create a comforting woozy feeling as the alcohol takes hold and the pub conversation coalesces into a pleasant background murmur. This is especially strong during the transition from afternoon to evening, a fascinating collective shift in mood. Le Coq is a classic example of this, treading a tightrope between the prosaic and the profound.<br>Beer fans will be pleased to learn there are other offerings than the AB InBev triptych, as their bottle menu is pretty decent. Price wise, it’s relatively expensive as it’s central Brussels, though you can sip safe in the knowledge you’re still drinking beer that would cost a third more exported to the UK.<br>The staff were charismatic and a little rough around the edges, which seems to suit the pub just right.<br>Le Coq is the place to go if you want to experience Brussels’ brown cafés’.",

My first visit to Strefa Piwa a couple of years ago was enjoyable, but the venue was yet to take off.<br>The pub is a fairly small narrow room with a curved ceiling in the style of a Pivnice decorated with a rather striking flow chart linking a hundred beer styles with their parent families. This gives a clue to their raison d’etre. I quite liked the fact it was a nice cross between a hospoda type drinking den but with some of the architectural features of a beer hall.<br>Two years ago a visit to Strefa Piwa would have been largely one to seek out a beer, with the atmosphere still a little ‘new’ and quiet, however that has all changed in the meantime. I’m pleased to say since that visit Strefa Piwa now has a core audience of locals who share space with clutches of travellers and backpackers. It’s a friendly, hustle and bustle type place that isn’t overly bothered about competing with the faded antiquey style bars down the road.<br>Because the décor is simple, it is the kind of place that needs a throng of people to lend it vitality, but now it has that, a great combination of incredibly high quality beer and a fun vibrant venue, that is still just about down-to-earth enough to not fall down the pretentious multi-tap beard-stroking craft venues. <br>To compliment the nod towards Czech pubs, there are a few high quality Czech ales along with craft Polish beer, and the range is wide enough that you can find something great in a range of styles. As per usual, the pricing while expensive by Polish standards is among the cheapest for craft ale you are likely to find around Europe.<br>Strefa Piwa succeeds by offering something different to the majority of Kazimierz bars, the pointedly different style seems to appeal to a crowd who are more interesting in drinking and socialising than ‘being seen’. It has a great location so works well as a stop off in between Plac Nowy and the old town in Krakow, similarly as an adjoinder to a night out in Kazimierz, or just for a casual evening out.

Although the place can look packed from the outside, this is a little deceptive as there are several areas within the building and people are spread out. Also, quite a lot of these ‘people’ were silhouettes of mannequins and marionettes, which is the theme of the bar.<br>While I enjoy the simplicity of a brown café or Czech hospoda I’ve always been a fan of bars cluttered with collected items as they give your eyes something to do while drinking, as well as adding a little charm to a place. <br>Walk up a couple of sets of stairs to the bar area and try to find a seat, as this is the epicentre of activity and the most ‘pub like’ the place gets – it also has the most to look at. <br>There is a medium sized and well chosen range of beers, most of which are top class Belgian ales, some of which are small scale and harder to come by. The price is surprisingly fair considering the immensely touristy location. The pub food offered is middle of the road but likewise inoffensive, really serving to provide a stodgy base for the beer consumption. They also offer free bar snacks which seems like a petty thing to worry about either way, but always adds a little something. Considering the number of people in the place, the service is skilled and efficient. <br>As with several Belgian places there is a slight blurring of what the place actually is – is this pub, or a café, or a simple restaurant. It’s all three to some extent, and you might find that doesn’t suit your own needs. Nevertheless it’s an atmospheric, friendly and very quirky venue serving high quality beer, and certainly one I would blaze a trail to over and over.",

Communal space.<br>Atmosphere/Character: Both a tavern and a performance area. Very intimate and occasionally intense. <br>Amenities/Events: Live Fado performances, food<br>Value For Money: Set price agreed on the door, normally reasonable for a one-off authentic experience.<br>description: Although you may see reviews of this place as a restaurant, the homely open-kitchen style and the late night atmosphere make this place definitely worth of the name pub – indeed the doors themselves describe the place as a ‘Taberna’.<br>That said, there is an entrance fee which covers the flow of wine and shots and the musical main event, fado, dramatically mournful Portuguese folk music. At the time of the visit this fee was 10 euros which at the time seemed very reasonable considering the wine and music were both very good.<br>This may seem a bit off-piste so far considering the beer halls and pubs covered on the blog, but be aware I have offered a degree of latitude to this venue on account of the authenticity and character. <br>Lisbon’s traditional working class neighbourhood the Alfama is the perfect setting for the place, and it can be difficult to track down while wandering up and down the maze of winding streets on the hillside. I remember we ended up locating it by deduction alone, and peering through a metal garage door. The front door itself was shut, but after a couple of knocks the owner met us at the door and arranged our seating after payment was made. <br>We gathered on a communal table in a small room, with most places taken, and were made to feel welcome with a couple of glasses of wine. There is no stage, and the musicians simply perform in the corner of the room. Each song is dramatic and passionate and the performers looked extremely well practised at the style. An overkill of maudlin music doesn’t seem like the basis for a night out, but the songs are short, melodic and received enthusiastically.<br>There are a great many corporate joints in the city centre offering fado performances with the meal, and while there is always a place for that, this is where to go for the real McCoy, stripped back, homely and raw in an unbroken folk tradition. <br>After considering the experience overall, I think aside of the entrance fee, it occupied a very similar social space as going to a pub, both in terms of the homely working class surroundings and manner of drinking.<br>Our visit extended long into the early hours of the morning leading to a very uncomfortable wakeup call the following morning to the airport!<br>There are a few other traditional fado venues in the Alfama, which I am sure warrant exploration, but I can strongly advocate visiting here if you like your experiences real and rustic. Finding this place on our final night in Lisbon more or less made the trip.",

I live in Leeds which has its fair share of arcades and side alleys, with several pubs of note to be found. Brussels is another city which hides many of its good pubs down little passageways, referred to as ‘impasses’. Down the end of one of these, only a few minutes walk from Grand Platz is A L’Imaige Nostre Dame.<br>The fun rabbit hole feel is enhanced on the inside as the window at the other side of the pub looks out over another impasse and another pub. This labyrinthine medieval feel adds so much character in itself the pub would have to be truly appalling to not be worth visiting.<br>It’s a cosy pub with a small bar area, sturdy furniture and the by now familiar tiled flooring. Despite the central location I’ve never found it to be overly busy, always ticking along nicely. The pub mainly serves clutches ofyoung tourists rather than locals, though there are on occasion groups of locals here, especially when there’s music in the back room.<br>The beer focuses on Trappist ale, presumably with the tourists in mind, and they push La Trappe which are tasty beers but not the premier Trappist brewers (indeed it was in dispute for a time whether their brewing really was in accordance with Trappist standards). There is a modest selection of other beers which are all pretty good, though admiteddly could be even better. They used to do bar snacks and degustations but appear to have stopped this at the moment. That’s a shame and they should bring it back if possible.<br>Because of its location I enjoy combining paying a visit to A L’Imaige Nostre Dame as part of a crawl. There is too much in the vicinity to spend all day in here, very nice though it is. You will get the most out of it by staying for an hour or so to enjoy the fun hidden away cavernly nature, and especially if there are some friendly travellers who are looking for conversation. I have a great fondness for the place and if I lived anywhere near central Brussels I would always drop by here on a night out.",

Earlier in the evening we had been wandering around an open air folk festival ‘Spancirfest’, which again we had known little about in advance. The centre was buzzing with stalls, street theatre and music, which alone gave a pleasant lift to our stay there. After doing the circuit of the town and around the castle we double backed onto ourselves hoping to find a bar in the vicinity to drop into. Most of these were busy but we stayed for a couple. On our way home I noticed a courtyard on our left and feeling curious ventured further in and found Garden Henry.<br>This venue is mainly open air, a terrace for cycling enthusiasts to congregate and drink a coffee. Varazdin was also hosting a protest against city plans to ban cyclists from the pedestrianised old town, which on balance seems completely unnecessary, but typical of the vagaries and petty feuds associated with town management.<br>This place was essentially their plotting spot, and they were selling tshirts and other merchandist in support of their cause. It was not apparent whether there was a bar or anywhere to get drinks, but we were approached by a gentleman who seemed to be co-ordinating some of the get together, and had a couple of cans thrust in our general direction. <br>The atmosphere was terrific as you could probably expect, a combination of the local buzz from the evening and really stylish design, upturned umbrellas, old cycles pinned to the walls and antique furniture in the courtyard. It’s the kind of place you would want to hang out in the summer pretty much anywhere.",

That was certainly the case when discovering Jazz Kocsma in Szeged.<br>There are a number of bars in Szeged city centre, although fairly few for a city of its size. The central pub scene seems to divide itself between student drinking and old man drinking, without too many crossover places which were tacky and corporate in any event.<br>Jazz Kocsma is set on an unlit back street 20 minutes out of the centre, in an area that is spookily quiet to the point of abandoned. When we approached the bar, its old wooden doors were shut and it seemed impossible to think the place had been open for years. <br>Desparate to find somewhere before heading back to our awful hotel, we tried the doors nevertheless and to our amazement found light downstairs, the place alive and accepting guests. There was a short break of silence as we walked in, our entrance most likely unexpected, and surveying the scene discovered a very ramshackle, ancient jazz club, with a corner bar area on the right and small stage on the left. <br>The beer options are perfunctory Hungarian stuff, unspectacular, but the primary quality of the pub was its atmosphere. Being very late at night things were slowing in pace, with groups huddling quietly around their tables in the candlelight. The mood lighting and gentle murmur of the crowd <br>Yes, the Jazz part of the title does actually mean something, and although there was no music playing at our late time of arrival, their calendar shows their live music events remain in full swing. It was easy to see from the interior how a Jazz band would elevate the experience even further. <br>This venue is a historical slice of local life that seems determined never to redecorate or change. Impossible to tell whether it was always this ad hoc, old and crusty or it has been happy to become so dilapidated. Regardless, the end effect is a powerful and distinct experience that will elevate your trip to Szeged.",

Furthermore, the locals are spending their time socialising with a determination and energy you could find in the UK in the early 00s. <br>Za Kulisami is a place that fits in nicely with informal post-uni drinking. The style is somewhere between ramshackle and psychedlic, with large bookcases, old tattered sofas and yet also a backroom with neon lights, and some rather moody and trippy decorations. <br>The crowd are lively, friendly and hang around by the bar. You will occasionally need to lean over shoulders to order but don’t be afraid to, there isn’t the same conservative personal space issue as there is in England. <br>The beers are a variety of regional medium sized brewers like Fortuna, Miroslaw and Brackie which makes an interesting middle ground between the Euro Lager giants and craft ale. They are decent enough quality and superbly cheap, weighing in barely above 1 pound a pint, which is alone noteworthy.<br>Quite a lot of the locals are into beer + vodka orders, and many places in Poland offer the combo at a slightly reduced rate, making it barely more expensive than ordering a craft beer, but far more effective at getting you drunk. We stuck to the beer, and found each visit to be relaxing and enjoyable. The place has a club-type character, and I got the impression a great many of the regulars knew each other well. A few visits to the place would soon ingratiate yourself, and as with a lot of other Polish cities, there are a surfeit of young people who speak great English without much opportunity to use it. <br>Za Kulisami is a great pub that seems to naturally filter out unsuitable types, and is so close to the Rynek as to be tempting almost every time you walk past. It feels much more like a friendly backstreet pub, word of mouth based with a regular cast. There aren’t many large cities where such a venue would be so central. It would hover around the top 3 choices for a pint in Poznan.",

They are nearly all 4 euros 50, which in certain cases is extraordinarily good value, meaning you can try rare small batch beers, quadrupel strength beers, lambic etc for less than you would pay in Brussels city centre. As you can expect, the quality is terrific. The bar also have 6 taps on rotation, largely German and Czech beer if you require lighter high-volume refreshment. <br>Aside from the beers being exceptionally good, the venue itself is cracking. Although the pub is street-facing, they have made a conscious choice to cut off the outside world (there isn’t much of a view anyway), so it is one of those places where the transition from outside to inside and vice versa is quite dramatic.<br>There is a rounded bar area and the main room is largely stool seating, however the room in the back offers a little more lounge comfort. The atmosphere is shady, candlelit and dramatic, the crowd a mixture of ruminating solo drinkers (referred to as “einslers” in German),couples and friendly youngsters enjoying the close feel and the gloom. <br>Such a place is very appropriate for knocking back Belgian ale, and before long all the outlines of your sight will start to become a little fuzzy. There is a reasonable turnover of patrons so if you don’t strike up a conversation at first, hang around and see what happens. <br>Kanguruh is a well-known about local legend, not likely to change in any way any time soon, and essential visiting while in Vienna.",

One of the very few bars outside London to service tank Pilsner Urquell on tap, no matter how great the rest of the bar may be, the temptation is always to order several pints of the good stuff stuff. You may have tried Pilsner Urquell on tap elsewhere, or in bottles, pasteurised and filtered, and struggled to work out what the fuss was about. As Headrow House are blessed to be able to serve the stuff unpasteurised and fresh from the tank, it comes with a natural shelf life meaning they have to get rid of it in 10-14 days after it’s opened, and they usually manage far sooner than that. Not going through the pasteurisation process where the beer is heated up, PU retains a great deal of its intended character. Always quite a volatile beer, here at least you can rest assured of a pint of it in good condition.<br><br>You might find the staff a little ignorant and sniffy, although on other days they can be perfectly fine. This comes with the territory, Leeds bar staff are often very far short from what you’d ideally want. If the place did enough volume they could justify a tapster, Czech style, simply delivering the beers themselves in pristine fashion, while the staff come around to deliver the beers. Unfortunately the variety of beer options and English custom dictate otherwise.<br>The music venue space is decent enough, and certainly one of the few venues anywhere where you can get such a great lager to enjoy with a gig. The cocktail area is a little mediocre in comparison to the rest of the venue, so keep on going up until you reach the terrace. If there’s even a hint of sun in Leeds you need to be here, soaking up the limited rays and enjoying the rooftop level view of Leeds’ Victorian domes and crenulations.<br>The décor follows a more mature ‘industrial chic’ look than most, with grass green upholstered bench seating in the main pub area and standard craft style benches running down the middle. It’s comfortable enough but there is an element of homeliness missing, and requires big groups to foster the sort of convivial atmosphere that inspires loyalty. That slightly corporate feel runs all the way through sadly, and you’ll find the price, service, décor, atmosphere all consistent with that.<br>Nevertheless on a busy evening or a summer’s day this is still the place to be in Leeds.",

The intimate space fills up quickly, particularly as there is dining space taken up. This is in itself interesting to spectate on. Styled as 'The Heart of Leeds', it really feels like that.<br><br>Amenities/Events: ❤️❤️❤️<br>Meals, snacks, outdoor seating, occasional beer festivals.<br><br>Value For Money: ❤️❤️<br>City centre prices<br><br>description: Amid a shower of mediocrity, Whitelock’s is a beacon for the values of preservation and tradition in creating a characterful pub. <br>Whether Leeds is serving up mediocrity in the form of cut-and-paste template industrial chic craft ale venues or boring chain pubs, you only have to look at Whitelock’s to tell the difference between a here today gone tomorrow fad, a vacuous meaningless container of nothing except Greene King IPA and sports screen and the timeless values that have helped a venue endure.<br>Whitelock’s itself was first founded in 1715, although you’ll find the current state more akin to late Victorian in style, with mirrored panelling, stained glass and tarred black wood. The pub was a ‘Luncheon Bar’, and during the day has much the same feel as it would have had back in the day, with a bustling busy atmosphere with food service and drinking intermingling. There is a stolid feeling of grandeur and it always feel like you are partaking in the upkeep of a fine tradition.<br>Situated down of one of Leeds many arcades, the pub used to stretch along the length of the arcade, a narrow snaking venue with effectively two bars (one of which is now a modernised cocktail bar called The Turk’s Head). The pub can be approached from either entrance, although I recommend the entrance nearest Trinity centre which provides the most rabbit hole like escape from the modern world and really makes you feel like you’ve been transported back in time. There are benches outside which can be nice on a humid day but are not the reason for venturing down here. Head inside and chance your arm at finding a seat – not an easy task sometimes.<br>The crowd at Whitelock’s rises and falls in swells. In the space of half an hour the scene at bar can change from a breathless tangle vying for space to calm and sedate, with a regular slowly enjoying a sup of cask ale perched by the brass serving area.<br>The bar area itself is a little unusual and old-fashioned, as despite the bar having a low ceiling, the staff seem raised above the level of the pub and after serving your pint, will deliver it down to you. The toilets are also odd, with a tiny staircase at the end of the bar which is almost like being on a ship rather than in a pub.<br>You’ll find some of the best classic real ales, along with some interesting local options. They have some forays into craft styles on keg with a modernised range, but could use much better lagers.<br>For a change, I would like to enthuse about the food. They have put a lot of thought into how to bring the idea of Luncheon menu into the 21st century, and have managed it, with most dishes having an English pub heritage, and using very fresh ingredients. You pay for it, but it’s pretty good. It isn’t just a generic pub grub place.<br>Once you’re inside and sat down, with only the dappled light coming through the frosted glass, you can really soak up your extraordinary environment and with it being a typically cosy old pub, it won’t feel like there’s any reason to move. Whole afternoons and evenings can come and go here supping quality pints of ales swaddled by comfortable surroundings.<br>By far the best pub in Leeds and due to its very particular features it could stake a fair claim to being one of the very best in the United Kingdom.

This pub looks unassuming from the outside, set in a fairly quiet corner of the neighbourhood and underneath the looming presence of the TV Tower. However the pub is a bit of a behemoth with a large beer garden in summer, ground level pub room decorated all over with tons of bric-a-brac and things hanging from the ceiling that could take you all night to inspect. Downstairs, there are further rooms offering a series of amenities, table football, pool, darts, TV, jukebox, much more set up for a young crowd than some of the almost pointedly spartan old man pubs in Prague. The downstairs space isn’t anything special in terms of décor, but it is a really nice place to be. There are a mix of locals and tourists and the size of the place gives you enough space to move about in while still actually feeling quite homely.<br><br>You'll find house beers (brewed elsewhere and relabelled), well worth a shout and the cheapest Belgian beer you’re likely to find anywhere. That’s before you get to some reasonably priced Czech beers from small and medium sized breweries. In terms of raw materials U Sadu packs a punch – and get this – stays open til 4am – which is crucial in a country still getting used to the idea of serving beer after 11 o clock (probably because all the natives have drunk themselves unconscious by 10pm).<br><br>You need to know about this place because it scores highly on most of the indicators you could think of for pub going. You can choose where to booze - this is a pub straining every sinew to provide for people, product, choice, comfort, atmosphere and remain open for people serious about making a night of it. These kind of places are more often than not the answer to the place ‘where next?’ – U Sadu is the archetype of that in Prague. (Added 2017)",

It’s certainly true the Tuscan idyll is perhaps not best demonstrated in Pisa, but that’s not to say the town is without charm, far from it. <br><br>The city centre is certainly one of those places that feels like the youth have taken over at night. Yes, you can sigh at the peeling plaster and graffiti in some of the downtrodden, otherwise classical piazzas but there is a certain verve and energy Pisa offers in compensation for that down and dirty feel.<br><br>Beer isn’t Italy’s strong suit, however it has belatedly made a concerted effort to catch up. When you have a little think about why it’s suddenly taking off, it makes sense. It’s the young folk who seek good beer out in Italy – just like in many other countries wine is seen as the preserve of the middle aged and middle class, or even if not, then more of a drink to enjoy with food. <br><br>It makes absolute sense beer and aperitifs would come to the forefront of a night out, as these appeal to the young crowd looking to be a bit hip and different, and because both go so much better over the course of a long evening. It must be said, in Italy good beer is a bit of a novelty, and so craft beer has been riding the crest of a rising wave for a few years.<br><br>Pisa’s very best exponent of this is Orzo Bruno, not just a place with good beer on tap, but a really, really good pub. In order to find Orzo Bruno you naturally find yourself wandering into the epicentre of the city’s nightlife. It’s a nice walk in, as you can feel the volume and excitement level gradually rise. You’ll find the pub and its unassuming exterior perched down a side-street, yet in the thick of the action. <br>Inside, it’s an informal affair with pinewood type seating falling somewhere inbetween modern and ramshackle. In the summer heat the windows and thrown open and there are tables and chairs outside. As with all great pubs, everyone looks like they’re having a good time. The best of all, it looks and feels predominantly like somewhere Pisans go themselves, with a ring of authenticity you just can’t fake.<br>On tap you’ll find local Italian brews for a decent price – their predilections for strong beers and German styles ensures you can purchase some strong, tasty stuff for quite a lot less than you’d expect. Wit beer, red beer, doppio malto, it’s nice to go to the heart of interesting Italian brewing styles and have a genuine isolated and authentic ‘Italian beer experience’ in what is a nice pub.<br>There’s a little something extra on offer too, that a lot of English people won’t be used to. It’s difficult to even find complimentary nuts with a drink these days, yet in Orzo Bruno dig into a veritable platter of snacks laid out on plates in front of the bar to enjoy with you beer. Spain and Italy are insistence that food must in nearly all cases accompany drink, which is a change of speed. You may want to consider leaving some room after your evening meal to enjoy the range of snacky bites on offer. A quick way of adding on further poundage on top of the calories in your beer.<br><br>Orzo Bruno works well whether at day or night, which is typical of places of its kind that stay low key and informal. You could pop in mid-afternoon and read a book with a pint of head here at 11 in the evening with a group. It’s just an all-round good place, reinforced by the enthusiastic patronage of locals. They also do discounts between 7-8.30pm, which is much later (and therefore better) than most happy hours in England.",

Tearing oneself away from the high quality known favourites such as U Hrocha or U Cerneho Vola is difficult enough in itself, and given a holiday may last only a few days, you could be forgiven for sticking to the known favourites.<br><br>However, several visits in, I am starting to chip away at the hundreds of available drinking holes and can strongly recommend doing so for the many gems that exist outside of the most touristic areas.<br><br>Jelinkova Plzenska Pivnice was a bit of a blot on my copybook, a pub I had known about since 2007 recommended in Prague Pubs as being an authentic tank Pilsner Urquell pub in the heart of the old town. By rights I ought to have paid a visit in the early days, but for one reason or another, things got in the way. This is partly down to the unconventional opening hours, being open only until 6pm on a Saturday and being closed altogether on a Sunday! Though inconvenient, it gives you a flavour already that this is a pub doing whatever the hell it wants, and sod the consequences.<br><br>Finally, after multiple occasions I had the opportunity to visit and did not pass this up. As with all the best Pilsner Urquell pubs, it is virtually impossible to leave after a single pint, with the devil on your shoulder telling you to go for one more, and the Czech traditional of inviting you for another the moment they spy you getting to the end of your glass. <br><br>Jelinkova Pivnice is a tiny pub and so when you visit don’t be surprised to find standing room only, if that. As you walk in you’ll find a square wood pannelled bar area and walls adorned with some classic Pilsner Urquell ephemera. There is an old fashioned open bar area with a sink where the tapster does his work. The tapster’s appearance is appropriately caricature, a rotund, smartly dressed fellow with white hair and a majestic and comically-curled moustache, helping transport you back in time to the good old days of interwar Bohemia, which is very much where this pub would rather exist. <br><br>One of the recurring features of these throwback places is treating tourists with a tolerance rather than an open arms embrace. If you can stand some good natured jesting and accept you are in the domain of the tapster and his stamgasty, perched by the bar having a chat, you’re assured of a good time nevertheless. Many of the regulars use their visit for conversation, so you may find one or two chirping up in English to get a conversation going. This is one of the hallmarks of a great pub and it is this unique environment, almost forcing people together at the bar to drink and talk which acts as the ice-breaker, so vital for a sole travellers in a foreign country.<br><br>The Pilsner Urquell is as good as you’ll find it anywhere, and you may find the format of standing results in you drinking more than usual – or it could just be the nerves! <br><br>There is a room around the back which receives table service (it will either be the rakishly thin lady or the preening lady of the house who serves you). Access to these tables can depend on reservations and at a loss of that, good luck. It’s a truly pleasant place to be with seating facing in around the room and creating that feel of conviviality you’re searching for when you try pubs like this. The format is simple and yet for other places make creating such genius loci seem like alchemy.<br><br>Though Prague is currently experiencing a wave in characterless craft beer bars, and has an almost bottomless trunk full of cheap but featureless macro-brewery branded drinking holes, you can’t walk far before a true pub hoves into view. The real job, as I’ve been finding, is being able to sort the wheat from the chaff, and knowing when is the best time to be there. Jelinkova deserves a high score because it is so different from the usual, it rewards perseverance and the best time to be there is simple: when it’s open.",

Stumble around backstreets only to discover the bar is deliberately not located correctly on Google. Google research the actual address, and find it’s different on six separate links. Ask locals living 100 metres away for directions to be greeted with shrugs of shoulders and blank expressions at worst, and vague arm waiving at best. Find the address then realise the street has two sets of numbers going in opposite directions (as many Florentine streets are wont to do). Find an archway with a courtyard that looks like a small shrine, with artwork and religious symbols hung on the wall in gilded frames.<br><br>You’ve found it. Find the bell. Ring the bell. 20 seconds later, an otherwise imperceptible hatch will slide open, and you will be greeted by a member of the team. You will walk down a ramp into a crimson carpeted lair. This is Rasputin, and you have arrived.<br><br>As you enter the cellar space you will notice the closeness of the air, but also just that vague hint of cellar dampness and coolness, the sort that years of DIY and damp-proofing can never really remove. This isn’t such a bad thing on a sweltering Tuscan evening. The waitress shows you to an intimate couple of seats. You look around the room to survey the scene. It’s like an ornate Tsarist crypt, trapped in time. What reinforces this the most is the children’s furniture in the centre of the room, which really lays on an element of the macabre. It’s so stylish it doesn’t even seem silly.<br><br>Far down the cellar you can see the bar in the distance, a bald, bearded rake of a man creating his delicious lethal cocktails, which are I’m afraid your only option in the joint. The waitress hands you the menu. 12 euros. 13 euros. 15 euros. Yes, this isn’t cheap, this is the bar where your bank balance falls off a cliff. In an obnoxious modern cocktail bar I would baulk at the thought of paying this much, and yet, on holiday, down in this delicious secret layer, you know what, just this once, just this once. And that’s how this bar operates really. The law of Just This Once.<br><br>The cocktails are lethal, whichever you choose. Looking around the room at the other guests in this alternate reality, and you can see everyone taking their time to savour every mouthful. It’s intoxicating in more ways that one.<br><br>This isn’t a place to go with ‘ver lads’, nor is it your mid-afternoon book reading destination. You come here in the late hours, when all civilized society is tucked up in bed, with a partner or a good friend or two and you get smashed, the crimson and otherworldly ephemera swirling in your head. As you sit there, you temporarily become actors, or objects in the scene. There aren’t many places like this.<br><br>The main downside is that everything feels very tightly controlled. Whether it’s taking pictures, or getting up to use the lavatory, right down to the last remants of your drink, there is an authoritarian grip to the whole proceedings, which I didn’t quite like. <br><br>However, while drink is in your glass and the company is good, there is no need to get caught up in things like that. <br><br>Some of you may think that paying 12 euros for a drink is unthinkable. Not this time. Not visiting Rasputin on your visit to Florence is unthinkable. You’ll pay more for worse experiences that don’t come with a lovely drink attached.",

Exploration of these pubs across Belgium and Netherlands will reveal a surprising diversity in décor and atmosphere.<br><br>Some emerged from a jazz/blues tradition and are decorated accordingly, even hosting live acts as a revival or preservation of that. There are some upscale brown cafes which take their cues from the roaring twenties: high society, art nouveau and all that. There are English/French style taverns which blend vaulted beams and thick wood with the bric-a-brac décor and beer ephemera you’d expect in a brown café. There there are working class venues with a simple format: rickety furniture, dusty floors, yellowed walls and good booze.<br><br>It seems though, whichever angle the owner deigns to take, the fundamental basics of what constitute a great pub are inherent in the DNA of a brown café which put them at a distinct advantage. Whether it’s the fantastic Belgian beer, their aforementioned styling choices, their character and atmosphere that evolves over the course of a day and remains as appealing whether you’re sat there on your own or among a tangle of people, you have to go pretty far to mess this concept up.<br><br>The rather crappily-named De Pilsener Club goes by another far better name ‘De Engelse Reet’, or ‘English Arse’. This place is one of Amsterdam’s core historic brown cafes dating back to 1893, and this place is content to be down-to-earth and working class.<br><br>There is a no-bullshit attitude to the entire arrangement: it’s brown alright, from the walls to the tables and chairs, and the floor has that aged spit-and-sawdust type look to it that probably has been cleaned daily but has been around so long it has received stains and wear that won’t rub out. Characterful, basically. A notable quirk is that there is no bar at all, all drinks are prepared in a backroom and then brought out.<br><br>Drinking is done across a set of communal tables along a small rectangular room with a fairly high ceiling, so you get a cosy surrounding but a woozy sense of space if you look up. The lighting and ambience gives that sense that it could be virtually any time of day and feel the same.<br><br>Drinking pilsener isn’t even half of the point of being here. The purpose of your visit is to drink some high quality, and invariably strong Belgian and specialist Dutch ale in these surroundings. Trappiste, abbey, lambics, micro-brewery stuff. These are proudly displayed above the head of the bar. Alternatively (or potentially in addition to) you can try their decent enough range of jenevers or order a cocktail (I’m not sure why you would feel the need to do the latter in a place such as this, but alcohol is a strange master at times).<br><br>There is a nice range of clientele in the place that give it a nice community feel. Old men sipping their beer over a newspaper, groups of youngster sharing conversation, couples diving in from the bad weather (in our case), business folk holding-forth over the worn-through tables. It is the kind of place which manages to be inclusive without turning itself into a safety first bland chain pub, and maintains what it wants to be without discriminating in the ageist and stylist fashion many craft beer pubs do. Of course, being in central Amsterdam will help, but natural advantages still count.<br><br>Beer isn’t cheap in Western Europe these days, and it’s no exception in here. Expect to pay 5 euros and upwards for a 0.25l pouring or a 0.33l bottle, although keep content in the knowledge the quality is among the best you’re likely to get. Given the savings to be made elsewhere in the city centre are 20 cents here and there at most, and that a pint of Heineken regularly clocks in at 5.50+ these days, it seems churlish to complain about paying 5 euros for a Rochefort 8. You certainly pay more in England.<br><br>As the evening progresses and the alcohol takes effect, the browns and off-whites of the room form a rather comforting hue, and the hubbub of conversation adds to that great calming melange where you really wouldn’t rather be anywhere else. And that’s great because it stays open until 2am.<br><br>In most towns and cities this place would be the best pub by a country mile. Up against seriously stiff competition in Amsterdam, De Pilsener Club eschews all gimmickery, sell-out concessions, and, if you excuse the waiter’s rather formal attire, modernisation of any kind, and does a good trade being what it is, a thoroughly likable, characterful place for a drink and a good time. Google reviews are almost uniformly positive about the place and after a visit it’s easy to see why. Mark my words, their words and place it firmly on your hitlist.",

Once you’ve managed to secure a comfortable standing or leaning spot you can enjoy the shocked and intimidated looks on people’s faces as though they’ve opened the wrong door into something truly disturbing.<br><br>The guy running the bar wouldn’t want it any other way, indeed you’ll notice many stickers around the bar area directing Erasmus students to an eff marked off. So what’s this all about then?<br>Well, Bar Pastis could mostly call itself something of a music venue. It seems silly considering the place most likely fits 20 people in at a push, but as true as day, there’s a small stage at the back of the bar that might allow 3 musicians at most, a table by the door that seems to become ever more useless and in the way as the night progresses (you can’t see the stage properly) and a few bar stools. If you’re desperate to sit down then prepare to be patient.<br>The music seems to vary between folk and jazz, the last visit involved a french folk duo which seemed perfectly appropriate for the location. <br><br>Rather than recoiling in disappointment, the sound of live music was just the ticket as we thrust ourselves inside, and leaned over a few bodies to order some drinks.<br><br>Although it is a pastis bar, you’ll find a beer/wine easily enough. These are perfunctory efforts, really but show there are at least some concessions. Expect to pay a little surcharge for when there’s music on, though this doesn’t run to much more than a few euro.<br> <br>The owner has a typical Rene type look, slick back balding hair, roman nose and paunch, and is very much master of his domain.<br> <br>While the music is playing you’ll find yourself drifting off into the surroundings which are some of the most crusty, ramshackle and amazing I’ve ever visited. The crimson painted walls don’t have much space left on them, taken up with gothic smoke damaged paintings, newspaper clippings and various cultural ephemera from decades past. There is a slight bordello theme with some vaguely erotic stockings gestures and the centre piece on the ceiling, almost certainly a remnant from a Mardi Gras type festival is a macabre mascot for a Bar of unflinching, uncompromising character.<br><br>No matter how many tourists attempt a pilgrimage to Bar Pastis, there is always a core group , while the transient custom of couples and folk music aficionados is only fitting for a bar of its kind.<br> <br>Although I could suggest a few changes, it seems almost rude in the circumstances when so much of the place lavishes you with new things to look at, new music and revelry to enjoy, or that bleary eyed soulful haze at the end of a night. Rejoining the street and heading down La Rambla afterwards feels like you just stepped back from a window into another universe, both real and yet unreal.<br>",

Perhaps it’s the old saying that variety is the spice of life?<br><br>The Dawson Lounge trades on being on the small side – which is to understate it – in fact, I’ve seen snugs with more wriggle room than this place. From the promotional literature and signage you’d be thinking to steer well clear, what with the Carlsberg insignia and cartoon suggesting a descending of louts to the place. This impression is further emphasised when contrasting the alternative establishments on Dawson Street which are very much upscale and upmarket, leaving this looking like a pimple on an otherwise pristine visage. At least from the outside.<br><br>Relievingly, appearances are deceiving – so don’t be deterred. With only a doorway as an entrance, you could be forgiven for walking straight past. Perhaps that, along with the tacky branding has some effect on maintaining the capacity inside so it doesn’t get too overblown the whole time.<br><br>As you open the door you’ll immediately step down into what feels like a bunker directly below street level. To give you an example of the proximity – if you approached the place from St. Stephen’s green and walked over the glass window insets on the street you’ll have been standing only centimetres away from someone’s head as they were positioned at the urinal. Interesting thought, eh? If you don’t believe me take a look directly above when you go to take a leak.<br><br>The creators of the pub have shown attention to detail in regards to the cramped space, as they’ve installed a leather cushion on the ceiling of the toilet cubicle so patrons don’t bang their heads on the wall!<br><br>Ron, pictured in the video above is the typical image of a Dublin publican, white-haired, broad-bodied and smartly dressed, the type of chap you’ll see asking for your order and offering good craic to the barflies all across the city.<br><br>The pub itself is merely a standing area directly ahead, and a seated area on your right, in front of the bar. Other than the ladies and gents, that’s your lot. With a low ceiling, wood-panels and framed artwork it’s like any other pub in that sense, but once that door closes behind you there’s no sense of claustrophobia, only the snug intimate feeling you’re hoping to get out of a visit. The carpets and décor help provide comfort rather than a feeling of being choked.<br><br>The guests are a mixture of local folk and tourists, but certainly no more touristy than this area of Dublin generally, and you may find a few locals bursting out into song later on at night if the mood takes them.<br><br>The main issue, as you’d expect from a pub with a capacity of 40 which has one row of seats and about 8 stools, is of obtaining seating room. The usual solution is to get there at opening time, although if you have bigger fish to fry and are inhabited of a little patience, wait a while and a stool or a position on the leather seats will become available.<br><br>It’s quite good all the same to choose a leaning post and a shelf – of which there are plenty – including a bespoke 30cm job above the bins by the bar – every inch of space is utilised.<br><br>Drinks-wise, expect the standard fare for Dublin, Guinness and much of the usual Guinness-owned alternatives, at a price neither exceptionally good nor terrible. It must be said the beer was very well kept when we visited and the temptation for a second pint proved irresistible, as I’m sure it will be for you.<br><br>What makes the pub stand out is it quirky, unique layout and intimacy – though there are more facets to it than that which all help make a truly outstanding experience.",

This is not to say there are no bars worthy of note, but after a while it becomes interesting to look at where Rigans are actually hanging out.<br>K.K.C is one of the answers to that question, set in a large building which looks somewhere between a mansion house or an old municipal building. It is located north of the old town in a fascinating area ‘Centrs’ full of tall pre-war modernist buildings, a hodgepodge of interesting styles, and yet all rather old, sad and neglected. The area feels like it has a lot of potential nonetheless, but whether there is enough money to bring that about is another matter. <br>K.K.C has an attractive courtyard area which the building wraps around, and lots of people are happy sitting around with a beer and socialising. Indoors there is a mixture of art space and more obvious bar-like areas, with friendly service, cheap decent beers and a refreshing DIY approach. The good reviews of the place are well deserved as it provides a much needed break from the norm, and in the summer especially it would be the ideal spot to hang out outside of the old town.<br>It has even more potential than they seem to realise, and it will be interesting to see whether they ever truly utilise the space, but for the time being you can come along for its exhibitions, concerts, or more likely just for a beer and a chat.

I’ll let other websites give you the history lecture – suffice to say, the pub is something of an institution.<br>Nevertheless, while this would usually involve rubberneckers treating the place like a Skanzen (see: York), the pub is still populated by a local crowd, and seems to serve the public in a very similar way it did in the past – attracting passing trade during the day, then becoming a homely drinking den at night shared by locals and people seeking shelter from the outside (this is Hull after all).<br>It really is one of those places to plan and plot over a pint (indeed it likes to sell itself, in dubiously ruritanial fashion as a ‘Plotting Parlour’) with crooked floors and ceilings, snug ante-rooms and a roaring fire, though there are also some grander touches with impressive stained glass windows and there is a stately venerability in addition to its homely feel. The fixtures and fittings, pub furniture etc is tar-coloured dark wood all the way, and thankfully nothing about this boozer suggests it has any plans on changing this format. Come leaking roofs or collapsing floors, the show goes on. <br>In keeping with the place, the beer options are traditional cask ales largely from the Yorkshire area designed for high volume session drinking. Once you’re sat down you’ll immediately feel like making this place your home from home. It is one of those pubs that inspires loyalty and devotion, yet if that isn’t possible paying the odd visit when you can feels only respectful. <br>Several tiers above most day-to-day venues, this is a place that almost defines pub going.

You’d expect a museum to be the best place to exhibit this but slightly surprisingly it takes the form of a bar – Gas Lamp.<br><br>Although aspects of the display are museum-like, to all intents and purposes the gas lamps are for decorative purposes, with little information on their design or origin. I have visited some pubs and bars which featured information labels on their antique without making the venue too stuffy-feeling (U Veverky in Prague, for example), but in Gas Lamp, providing you are here for a drink over and above a history lesson, you don’t feel like you’re losing out for the lack of information too much. Besides, the venue holds one of the biggest collections of gas lamps in Europe, so there is a lot to look at.<br><br>On busy evenings, an old man in a top hat, holding his gas lamp will guide you past the ‘fathers of the lamp’; two bronze statues, one of Jan Zeh sitting at his table (by the front door) and another, if you look up, of Ignacy Lukasiewicz poking out of a third-storey window. Read about their place in history here.<br><br>You are then led downstairs into a cellar. Counter-intuitively you have to crouch under what appears to be blackened rock, only to ascend a spiral staircase into the ‘bottom’ floor, which is on the first storey of the building. When you reach it you will notice a traffic light system, which appears to be there to stop customers bumping into each other halfway down the stairs.<br><br>Gas Lamp is set across several small floors, which reminded me of De Garre in Bruges (in layout rather than design), one of which is dominated by a bar, and another which appears to be a penthouse apartment that has been converted into a covered roof terrace. There is a coherent theme but each floor has a slightly different feel so don’t leave without being nosy and having a look arou<br><br>On the top floor you emerge level with what appears to be a sea of slanted rooftops which may well be impressive during the day as much as at night, but night time is a great opportunity to look at the Armenian and Russian churches lit up strikingly. There is a naturally rather rarified air to being on the top floor so it may appear a little more towny and flash in comparison to the cosier downstairs rooms. Regardless of this, it is well worth rubber-necking.<br><br>Outside of the eponymous gas lamps, décor is an interesting blend of chunky chalet-type wood, with rafters, beams, bannisters and communal tables, but the lighting is more modern, with yellows, pinks and purples spotlit and backlit among shelves with other assorted valves and measuring equipment. I would rather they lit the gas lamps to be honest, but it’s not a bad effect overall and is more impressive than the images you’ll find online.<br><br>Drinks wise, Gas Lamp offers shots in a row of test tubes as a gimmick (make of that what you will), and a well stocked bar for cocktails and the like, but I opted for Pravda and Lvivske’s beer offerings which are still reasonably priced for such a central location. That’s not difficult however, as from a Western perspective nearly everywhere apart from the airport is reasonably priced.<br><br>Gas Lamp serve food, although I found the location to be far too dark to contemplate getting anything there other than emergency snacks to soak up the beer. I don’t really see the appeal of arriving here any sooner than sunset to be honest. Night time is the right time.<br><br>Staff are well used to tourists and speak decent English, however there were issues getting their attention. Sadly unless you go direct to the bar, you’re stuck with table service, an always retrograde format that slows everything down unnecessarily. That isn’t isolated to Gas Lamp however, but pretty much everywhere that also serves food.<br><br>The city of Lviv offers a night life replete with themes and gimmicks, and yet another rears its head when you pay the bill. A ‘bomb’ with a short fuse is lit when your bill is presented, and you can enjoy a puff of flame, cracker-type pop, then a mix of smoke and incense fills the room. Unnecessary of course, but characterful. European Bar Guide is after all very keen on places which don’t settle for mediocrity. Some places would never get away with this but it felt amusingly dorky.<br><br>Exciting, ever that little bit different, popular enough to have atmosphere but also spacious enough to give corners for quieter evenings, Gas Lamp is a very successful execution of its concept, and with one or two tweaks could really push towards being a 10/10 venue.<br><br>It comes highly recommended but as much as we bang on about it, we’d love to hear your stories from Gas Lamp and Lviv – please get in touch!",

However, this was an example that demonstrated why its reputation was fully justified.<br>Café Den Turk is located very centrally and appears to have been preserved over the years by the frequenting of officials from the town hall nipping across the road for lunchtime and post-work drinks.<br>The pub has striking signage from the exterior and is located in a classic stepped gabled Flemish house, sending positive signals before you’ve even walked through the door.<br>The interior is one of those classic pubs that have so clearly and resolutely refused to change with the times. Furnishings and bar area are similar to a brown café but the layout more like an English pub with side rooms and corner seating, all proudly old fashioned.<br>The choice on tap is a pointedly sensible working class array of typical AB InBev products but they stock a decent selection of bottles, including a few Ghent beers. Ghent Tripel is nice but not a Ghent beer strictly – it is brewed to order elsewhere and relabelled but Gentse Gruut is brewed just up the road, and the blonde makes a sensibe choice for a first drink in Ghent. Gruut style beer is brewed with spices in substitution for (or sometimes in addition to) hops, leading to a different flavour balance. The spices are also slightly botanical and bitter which balances well against the sweet Belgian blonde.<br>The pub regulars look dyed-in-the-wool and give you that vaguely reassurring feel that while they remain in attendance everything is ticking over nicely. Expect a few stares to greet you on your entrance, but the service is welcoming, if a bit upright.<br>The one slight quirk is the red and white patchwork tablecloths which don’t seem to fit the brown café style or the jazz bar intentions it casually wears on its sleeve. <br>An afternoon drink is quiet and but nevertheless relaxing, but I recommend visiting in the core of the evening where everything takes on an atmospheric and shady glow, and the murmur of conversation starts to bubble up. In the evening there is an understated jazz and blues soundtrack which are naturally complimentary and the whole effect coalesces to become a brilliant pub.<br>It is deservedly an institution, and a visit to Ghent without popping down for at least one at Den Turk would be to deny you one of the city’s finest and most authentic offerings.",

You have to remind yourself it used to be a military barracks for the Yugoslavian army, because given what’s happened to it since the early 90s, it’s close to unrecognisable. Along with the less salubrious aspects (the ones usually pushed by the media to alienate them), it’s worth pointing out the community work, the championing of liberal values and the commitment to peace and freedom that Metelkova represents and lives by.<br>The whole complex is taken up by clubs and bars, and indeed there is a hostel on site, but the epicentre of proceedings is Jalla Jalla, a bar set in a hut in the centre of what was, presumably the parade grounds.<br>Don’t expect any home comforts or fancy ales here. You’ll be lucky to get a can of union for a euro, while the bar specialises in their moonshine, ‘Bear’s Blood’, a cherry liquer. You can bring your own ale into the grounds anyway (though not the clubs), so it’s hardly a problem. <br>How busy this all is depends on the season and day of the week. It was reasonably quiet when we visited but the place would be quite a sight in the height of summer. Take a drink and hang around the climbing frames with the local dropouts discussing politics and having a laugh. <br>When it’s time to spend a penny, hold your nose for the ludicrously stinky ‘toilet’, basically a metal sheet with a hosepipe draped in its general direction. No idea at all what the ladies options are in this regard. There was a screen, so, squatting?<br>I’d recommend dropping by during the day to get your best look at the amazing and bizarre pieces of art around the place, and visiting on Fridays and Saturday nights if you’re up for a drink and a hang out. It’s unmissable on any visit to Ljubljana and a huge change of speed from the mainstream nightlife in the pretty, baroque centre.",

It’s a down-to-earth community greeting that may take aback those used to more a reserved, private experience. There is no forced jollity however, don’t worry about that. On a weekday evening or Saturday afternoon especially don’t be surprised to encounter a bar area thronged with people.<br><br>The longstanding publican Michael Webster will give you a straightforward and honest North East greeting and absolutely has your interests at heart. On a busy day you may be offered a seat in the back – unusually this can be accessed via the bar hatch, but also via a couple of sets of doors at the back of the bar.<br><br>Pubs of this sort were conceived with an understanding of the concept of genius loci, a harmonious use of space to create a genial special atmosphere. The local architect Joseph Oswald who designed the hotel prior to its construction in 1899 appears to have fundamentally grasped what layout would produce a special venue. Since then, what changes there have been to its appearance have been kept to a minimum. This is now protected by Grade II listed status.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The layout, fixtures and fittings have been well preserved, including some genuine curios such as their vintage coin till, and the service bells fixed in the frames of the bench seats. Some of you may have seen in traditional pubs and know they are nearly always found to be out of action. Well, they have rigged up a new call bell and it’ll be nae botha (within reason) if you use it to attract the attention of the bar staff. Victoriana at its finest, as WhatPub splendidly describes.<br><br>However distinctive the venue may be, a pub its nothing without the atmosphere created by its patrons. While the décor in the Victoria is rightly prized for its distinctive and well-preserved quality – almost a museum in fact – the customers, along with the enthusiasm and commitment of the staff (an impression which is imparted by everything they do) give the place a vibrancy that others pubs don’t match, for all the wax and varnish they may apply. In my opinion these folks are as integral a part of the pub’s character as the marble fireplace, quirky side rooms or any eccentric array of chintzy royal memorabilia.<br><br>For many years The Victoria has offered as its permanent ale ‘Big Lamp Bitter’, a full-flavoured and now rather old fashioned brown bitter of a sort which fits in with the experience of visiting The Victoria very well. You will find other local ales on rotation, for prices which are a little higher than most in the area, not that this deters the locals.<br><br>On the Saturday we visited, their kitchen had put on a spread of what can only be described as Durham tapas, traditional North Eastern grub mixed in with the kind of tuck you’d expect to fill the Famous Five’s hampers. You’ll be warmly invited to help yourself and get stuck in. They don’t much stand on ceremony around this area, and all the better for it in my view. Outside of tapas days, food may limited to toasties. Factoring in the hospitality here, their prices become far fairer.<br><br>The venue still operates as a hotel and you may see visitors hustled through the back with their suitcases and up the stairs to the guest rooms. In the morning they will enjoy a full English breakfast rustled up by local legend Maureen, reportedly well worth a try.<br><br>We spent most of our time in the small lounge at the back of the bar, a beautiful and cosy room with dark red detailed wallpaper, coal fires and hosting domino games.

The choice for a pub crawl is bountiful and very difficult to cover every bar of merit in one trip.<br>Alchemia is the beating heart of Kazimierz, based directly on Plac Nowy. On a warm summer night there are seemingly no real joins between the limits of the bar and the zapiekankie stalls on the square itself, with groups congregating, milling about, enjoying a drink and the buzz of the social scene, sometimes even with street music as the often well marked boundaries pub going are ripped up in favour of an almost Latin American/bohemian feel. <br>It isn’t all about the al fresco socialising though, that is merely a happy consequence of its popularity and position. The pub itself is superb, and the intimate atmosphere in certain nooks and crannies is almost a contradiction from the vibrancy on the street.<br>You couldn’t visit a more archetypal antiquey-themed place. Tables and chairs are set to candle light while vintage furniture is spread across the rooms. The rabbit hole feel is continued even further by having to climb through a wardrobe into the back room. <br>The colours are red, velvet and the woozy glow of candlelight. The bar is usually busy enough that most seats are taken but not so busy that you can’t swoop on a vacant table a few minutes later, and spend an hour or two luxuriating in the faded cracked grandeur and the collective feel that seems to permeate through the venue that this is the place to be.<br>The bar serves tank Tyskie for pennies and the range of Ksiasece beers which are a step up from the normal range of Polish lager, especially the wheat beer, but at the time of writing the Polish craft beer scene hasn’t yet arrived. There are plenty of places nearby for that in any event.<br>Alchemia may be somewhat of an institution, and I expect some locals may feel it is passe, but there is no denying its intrinsic quality and the essential journey you must make to Alchemia upon your visit to Krakow.",

Unfortunately the pub scene in Sarajevo is dominated by these options as a young crowd grasp unsuccessfully at a vague simulcra of what they believe Westerners are doing. <br>We shouldn’t be too judgemental, as the working class are often the most sensitive to social status, and there is not a lot of money around. Sarajevo is still recovering culturally from the war and trying to reforge themselves, which at some point will inevitably involve retracing and exploring their heritage. Hopefully this will result in some interesting and atmospheric alternative pubs and bars, but until then, enjoy your poor fascimile of a bad night out.<br>Once this crushingly depressing situation becomes apparent, the desire to rush headlong into the historical character of Sarajevo, or seek out anything remotely alternative becomes immediate. <br>Thankfully, in spite of everything I’ve said above, such a place exists.<br>Zlatna Ribica (Gold Fish) is a place of exotic eccentricity, stuffed with antiques and features that could keep your eyes occupied for hours. The sheer volume of it exceeds even the bar’s internal surroundings and even spills out onto the street, with one of their eccentric gadgets and bits of furniture occupying the street front. Yes, you will find some gold fish, bowls stacked over piles of books, ornate antique lampshades and waxed sideboards and rails studded with crenulations and detailing. The bar may be ornamental but it is also extremely quirky, with objects positioned where they shouldn’t be, and the oddest objects rearing their heads. Don’t be alarmed by the portable black and white TV in the toilets resting on a toilet roll showing lions mating in the Savannah.<br>This arrangement is all managed by a man who looks like he has felt obliged to look and act in keeping his surroundings, or perhaps this has just been the effect the place has chiselled into his character. A rather pointedly unusual chap with longish dark hair and a slightly gothic effete. He will provide you with bottles of Sarajevsko to drink (there were no other beer options I saw) at standard prices with the requisite level of enigma and after that, you can recline in a truly unusual and richly atmospheric pub, which feels like being in a mad professor’s study.<br>A: 5/10 B: 10/10 C: 10/10 D: 5/10 E: 7/10 F: 10/10",

Wherever you turn, each hostinec, hospoda, pajzl, minipivovar or výčep seems to be full. It is no exception when it comes to U Kuděje. Yet, frustrating though that is, there is all justification to persevere as you are searching for a drink in one of the best pubs in the city, if not in the whole country.<br><br>At first appearances Hospůdka U Kuděje may seem unremarkable. A Czech pub in a half-step basement of a very Czech city building? – seen plenty of those before. Wooden furniture from the Austria-Hungary era, with traditional ruralist décor? A well-trodden choice, too but the true quality of U Kuděje is the combination of a number of smaller things contributing to a greater whole, known as genius loci, or spirit of a place. Which we will now come to.<br><br>U Kuděje is not based slap bang in the centre (it could potentially lose a fraction of its charm if it were) but a short walk west on the fringes between Olomouc’s old town and a residential neighbourhood west of Čechovy sady.<br><br>U Kuděje is named after the writer Zdenek Kuděj, the closest and perhaps long-suffering friend of Jaroslav Hašek, who were both part of an anarchist/bohemian literary scene in the early 20th century, so is a fitting tribute to someone who spent huge amounts of time in pubs. You will find theirs and others’ works available to read (in Czech, of course) within the pub. Here is a short explanation of the pub and connection to the writer: http://www.memorialmatejekudeje.cz/?cat=14<br><br>Drop down a short set of stairs outside to the basement level and enter, where the bar area greets you immediately, with a list of beers attached above the bar. The place feels warm and bunker-like and you will almost certainly find people sat at stools around the bar, and a cast of regulars sat on tables to your right. To your left is a small lounge area with people deep in conversation and set into the ritual of the place itself.<br><br>The pub has the atmosphere you’d expect from a neighbourhood dive and you’ll quickly notice from the interactions there are folk sat around who know each other well. This in my opinion is the core of the pub’s appeal, the warmth and simplicity of a social scene that people invariably seek out when given the choice.<br><br>A busy pub full of locals can be intimidating at first, and if you can’t see anywhere to sit you may be forced to hang at the bar (also awkward if there is no leaning room). Take a full look into the pub and if there is a spare seat ask “je tu volny”, and hopefully someone will yield. If you arrive as a group in the evening without a reservation, then all I can say is: Good luck. Yep, unfortunately Czechia does not do first-come-first served in pubs and will reserve tables for loyal locals at the expense of fly-by-night tourists and turf you out of your seat when the time comes.<br><br>U Kuděje’s big thing – atmosphere aside – is a focus on regional Czech beer, which is very good news for any fans of unfiltered and/or unpasteurised lagers (me). Offering 5 or so on tap at any one time, this is a sensible number that helps ensure freshness, and a little rotation for new and recurring brands. The beers are also served on porcelain plates built with recesses to collect spillage – this is very old fashioned but seems to be making a comeback of late.<br><br>They may try to suggest that these beers are good for your health but quite frankly, who cares? If it makes you feel better then yes, yeast can in theory help repopulate your stomach with good bacteria. However if you need it repopulating because of an excess of beer the previous night then that rather negates the point, doesn’t it? Prices are reasonable, perhaps on the high side for Olomouc, which isn’t a problem given Olomouc is an extremely affordable city.<br><br>The pub snacks at U Kuděje are typical for Czech pubs – expect the usual cheese, ham, pickles but keep a look out for Moravian cheese if that’s your thing, as that’s quite the regional speciality.<br><br>Lastly, take a look at the opening hours – few places open later on a Saturday than they do during the week, but U Kuděje is one of them This place is does a short 5 hours service on weekends, and opens at 3 during the week. This makes it doubly difficult to try and get into.<br><br>Although U Kuděje may be a tough nut to crack as an outsider, I personally couldn’t think of too many pubs on my travels I’d prefer to make the effort to ingratiate myself in. You’ll find the true atmosphere and camaraderie of a mixed crowd partaking in a time-honoured tradition, rate authenticity, not to mention enjoying some of the freshest, well-kept and well-poured lager available.",

Emotionally, being able to track certain parts of our lives to the past, as fundamentally futile as that endeavour may seem, helps to provide us with a sense of dignity, in the knowledge that we have retained and respected things of value along the way.<br>Café Vlissinghe is Bruges’ link to the past, a pub traceable for centuries and very much keen on changing as little as humanly possible. Once you have a good thing you don’t let that go.<br>Nevertheless, there are other things going on here than a pocket sized ethnographic museum, Café Vlissinghe stocks a new beer Fort Lapin brewed in a garage five minutes up the road by a new brewer, but even with this choice, you get the sense of sentimentality and heritage at wanting to promote a city project, even with the hundreds of other Belgian beers they could have chosen to sell.<br>Vlissinghe is located down a type Bruges backstreet. Cobbled, white painted walls, ancient brickwork, and even older bicycle propped up outside. The 50 metre walk off the street to the pub is now somewhat of a ritual for me, just long enough to build the sense of anticipation.<br>The pub itself is really just one central room, creaking with old but sturdy furniture and warped floorboards, with faded oil paintings on the wall and an impressive cast iron steam heater in the centre of the room kicking out terrific heat into the room. Typically there is a pub dog, who is happy pottering around, giving things a sniff before having naps here there and everywhere.<br>The main room overlooks a garden and terrace area used as a bowling green in the summer and has outhouse toilets, which are thankfully not hanseatic league era.. The kitchen is in an adjoining building and focuses on winter fuel and bar snacks, which are all Belgian style and tasty. Service is friendly but occasionally disorganised and slow (forgivably), and the prices are part for the course.<br>The main appeal is the sheer sense of relaxation. Whether it is 11.30 in the morning or last thing at night, I doubt anything about the feel of the pub would change hugely. Hunker down for an afternoon of supremely enjoyable beer drinking and hearty soups and breads among an environment of true character",

The venue is large enough to be classed as a club and there are certain similarities, but it feels far more relaxed than that. Indeed, they open during the afternoon where there is a sleepy, bohemian vibe with people relaxing among ruined, squatter type surroundings, however decorated, scrawled on, layers upon layers of ephemera to a hyperreal extent. <br>There have been attempts to transplant elements of the style which have all been only partially successful, because Szimpla’s style is so heavily ‘user-generated’ and doesn’t feel conceited.<br>‘Kert’ meaning garden, there is a large atrium area, peaceful and verdant in the day, then lively and buzzing at night. There are usually films and art pieces shown, occasionally live music, and one of the most spectacular sights at night as a huge chimney stack towers above, one of the most dramatic and chance additions to an already impressive ensemble. Sit in a converted car, smoke shisha, move upstairs to the craft beer bar and hang out among the vintage furniture and enjoy the view below. Someone might even walk around selling carrots for you to eat.<br>Due to the size, the sheer extent of the amenities never feels crammed in or spilling over each other. You can wander around, dipping in and out of the attractions at your leisure. Each visit is ever so slightly different as the place transforms so much at different times of day and conditions, morphing into a new experience. The great feeling it manages to put across is a sense of detachment from the outside world, this strange oasis where many of the rules and worries no longer apply.<br>You’ll be pleased to know it’s free to enter, indeed part of the appeal is the laissez-faire nature of it all, and the prices are very fair considering its position at the cultural and geographic epicentre of Budapest’s bar scene and nightlife.<br>The range of drinks were always reasonably good, with some unusual choices (dark Slovenian lager, Kriek, Schneider Weisse) thrown in. It comes across a little bit unplanned but in reality you get a good range at corresponding prices. There is also a new upstairs craft beer area which while a little predictable for a bar of such quality, is probably not such a bad thing in a country starved of venues selling anything except Hungary’s dreadful Euro Lager.<br>On just about every measurable and immeasurable score, Szimpla excels. There is the growing suspicion Szimpla no longer attracts too many locals at night especially, and the last few visits I have noticed it contains a huge number of English speakers, backpackers and city-break tourists. This is often not such a great thing, but the universally friendly feel the place exudes seems to rub off on all who enter. Szimpla is a cornerstone of a great night out and deserves its plaudits as one of the greatest bars in Europe.",

Following a visit this year I’m pleased to report nothing has visibly changed, except potentially the price of the Pilsner Urquell, (although this itself has not varied hugely on my wallet with the fluctuations in the currency exchange rates).<br>The interior is the same as always, a very cosy bar room offset at the angle of the hill running up towards the castle, the walls slightly yellowed by virtue of the years of smoking. There is a second room across the hall which I have never ventured into but appears to be an extension of the pub as a whole.<br>The staff, (a venerable duo) are still in attendance, growing increasingly grey and rotund. The tapster that we christened Wolfman is still churning out glasses of pristine Pilsner Urquell with his enigmatic expression that in turns suggests fury and satisfaction, keeping the place going with a dyed in the wool commitment that gives the impression this will remain the case for decades to come.<br> <br>U Hrocha (The Hippo) is the kind of pub where a slight wrist movement or wiggle of your dying glass of beer, or even just a nod will be enough to secure your next drink. The beauty here is all in the simplicity, cutting back the B.S and letting the true purpose of your visit, socialising and drinking take its course.<br><br>There is a true vibrancy to the place and securing a seat itself is satisfying enough before the beer arrives. Part of the reason for this is that the locals will not relinquish it to tourists, and make a point of turning up early and indeed reserving seats at the bar. This may seem impudent and petty but it serves a core purpose. The pub wants to keep a crowd of locals in there and they have all right to. Don’t be afraid however, a polite few words in Czech will keep the duo on your good side, and they seem just as happy to serve all-comers who want a drink and a chat.<br><br>The Pilsner Urquell is  kept and poured exceptionally well (vitally important for a temperamental beer often varying in quality), served in the Czech style with about two inches of head, obliging you to dive in nose first to a mound of foam. The ‘mother’s milk’ from Pilsen is really Prague’s stock beer, despite Staropramen being Prague’s largest brewery.<br> <br>One slightly sad aspect of venerating U Hrocha is that it is a down to earth, everyday sort of place, albeit with an atmospheric interior. The pub is propelled to the point of distinction because it genuinely feels like a Prague institution, at a loss of many other options. Place it as high as possible on your list of Prague pubs to visit, and turn up at opening time to get a seat! (2017 Founder Member)<br>",

A lot of these bars are visible, centrally located and on the tourist trail, and with only a few exceptions serve extraordinary selections of gorgeous Belgian ale.<br>It took me 4 visits before I found the bar Goupil Le Fol, but one visit was enough to propel it to the top of the charts. <br>A quick map reference confirms Goupil Le Fol is situated very close to the Grand Platz, just not on one of the major tourist thoroughfares. The bar does not look extravagant in any way from the outside, and I got the impression before visiting that this remains a bar for locals rather than tourists. <br>Opening the door instantly feels like the entering of a bunker or tunnel, a long windowless and low-ceilinged, and studded with adornments on any bare surface.<br>The man and woman serving appear to be a couple and one of those couples who like both trying to do the same one job. The bar is right next to the door, and with no menu and no beers visible behind them you have to ask for their selection, which is a modest but reasonably well chosen range of 7-8 bottles. <br>You then begin the walk along the passage, deeper and deeper into the bowels of the bar, past an original wurlitzer jukebox and much jazz and 1950s memorabilia. Carrying on further until finding upholstered bench seating in a very cosy, slightly wider room. There are entire books nailed to the wall and vinyl records on the ceiling. This is where we sit. <br>The crowd are a typically belgian blend of cultures, all of which sit together in an extraordinarily atmospheric environment. The belgian beer is working its magic and the coloured lights in the bar are glimmering off the records and any other surface with shine on it. There is much to look at and talk about in true comfort, exchanging glances across the other side of the room, everyone happy and resolved they have made the right choice of venue for the evening.",

Step-free access.<br>Value For Money: Standard for the area.<br>description: 10/10<br>The alchemy of what constitutes a good pub is worthy of considerable study, and partly why this site was created. The Little Bruges Bear is an excellent place to begin.<br><br>While there are so very many hundreds of bars and pubs across Europe missing essential ingredients, scrambling in the dark in their search to attract patrons, despite having a reliable formula almost laid out for them, this pub serves to illustrate how simple the task is.<br><br>t’Brugse Beertje is a cosy communal venue with the dimensions and confines of a snug brown café/pub decorated with wood panelled walls and adorned well selected and stylish bar ephemera. There is a choice of simple wooden seating or slightly more comfortable bench seating if you’re lucky enough to swoop in and claim it. Ask to peruse their enormous menu of Belgian beer, presented in the form of an almanac that takes a good 20 minutes to look through properly and consider a selection of typical Belgian snack options (gouda, biscuits, meat platters, croque monsieur etc) to go with. Just thinking about this while writing is salivating.<br><br>Hanging above the bar is a gleaming selection of the various beer glasses each tailored to their specific beer, every single flavour journey mapped out by their brewers right down to the way the beer sits in a glass, tempered to the point of maximising every single potential for an improvement of the experience, telling of a country utterly obsessed with the art of brewing and the pleasure of drinking. There will be a beer for you in this pub, or I’m afraid there is no beer for you.<br><br>Service is efficient and attentive, while the prices are 20-30 cents higher than other nearby places, but not punishingly so. This can be offset by choosing a rare beer you’re unlikely to get anywhere else (my suggestion would be to try an Oud Bruin/Flemish Red style, which apart from Rodenbach are less commonly exported to the UK, while curiously, the style hasn’t yet caught on as a craft brewing style despite the proliferation of red ales and sours).<br><br>BrugsBeertje_tcm13-9835<br><br>The enormous popularity of the place has unfortunately driven locals away apart from a few quiet months in the New Year before Easter. Normally it would earn a mark down for that, as it’s important for a pub to have an original community element, but the place must be given a free pass. The ideal would be for it to contain a healthy mixture of both locals and a few tourists, but the world has taken over Bruges in the last 10 years. In lieu of local life, the shining qualities of the pub, that seem to epitomise everything good about traditional beer drinking in Belgium, compensate adequately.<br><br>The pub opens at 5pm and by 5.30 nearly every seat is taken. After that it’s a case of waiting politely at the door and taking your chance to swoop to a seat. Once seated, it’s unlikely you’ll see a reason to leave any time soon. It’s a rare example of a place where I would actually wait for 10-15 minutes to be seated.<br><br>The main room has a terrific atmosphere, watching folk come and go, but if that’s not available, the backroom has a lovely down-to-earth feel, like a rambler’s pub full of strangers thrown together in the tangle of a boozy evening. This compensates well for the lack of local characters. Only the matter of being on holiday, in Bruges of all places could distract a visitor from staying there all night, returning at opening time the next day and doing the same. It is the best pub in Bruges and there’s no doubt that this is pub going at its very best.<br>A: 10/10 B: 10/10 C: 10/10 D: 5/10 E: 6/10 F: 10/10",

The hubbub of lively conversation, laughter and friendly voices are an encouraging invitation to join in.<br>In an unprepossessing courtyard outside Piwna Stopa (Beer Foot), it isn’t immediately apparent what to expect, until you approach the door when the sounds from inside start to reach you. <br>Walking inside swiftly confirms those sounds of encouragement were well founded, revealing a homely down to earth venue akin to an English pub in style and feel. There is a real fire near the bar, the walls are plastered in old beer labels and bar mats, and there are lots of comfortable dark wooden furniture, bookshelves and board games, and a small TV mounted near the ceiling, a slight concession to sports fans perhaps? Yes, but also as likely, for the staff to watch TV during quiet times. As with all great pubs it feels like your temporary home for the afternoon/evening.<br>Don’t worry about any excess of tourists, Poznan itself is not overly touristy outside of the Rynek in high season, while the venue is just far enough outside the old town, in a secluded spot to be virtually invisible to passing trade. The reason Piwna Stopa is busy and popular is all down to word of mouth –that word of mouth exists because this pub is really damn good. <br>The reasons already stated would be enough on their own to class it as a venue of real merit, but pleasingly enough, there are other aspects which all contribute to its special feel. The staff are friendly, enthusiastic and helpful. Indeed one staff member noticed we had returned the following day despite being two of a hundred people and they were very welcoming and pleased to meet our English selves.<br>With a name like ‘Beer Foot’ you wouldn’t be mistaken to think this was another pub wedded to Poland’s growing craft beer scene. The bar area manages to tread the fine line between the increasingly predictable and identikit ‘multi tap’ style and a more traditional pub. Beers are listed clearly enough on the blackboard by the bar, and were on frequent rotation. The emphasis was on strong flavourful beers of traditional styles rather than too many gimmicks (Lemon Meringue Pie &Himalayan Sea Salt Gose etc etc) and these were all good quality. The Polish craft beer scene is a little derivative of US and English styles though, and it would be nice to see and taste further resurrection of their own beer heritage, and good examples of beers from neighbouring countries (Germany and Czech Republic especially) rather than the millionth attempt at American Pale Ale.<br>In addition to the beer they also do some basic food, usually one-pot type cooking, the smells of which waft through the room and looked heart enough to help line your stomach for the drinking ahead. The prices in here are fair considering the higher strength and overheads associated with craft brewing, and in a wider sense, it must be conceded Poland offers some of the cheapest high quality craft beer you can buy in Europe. The Pub actively market themselves and put on events, clearly trying to foster a community spirit, which on the evidence at my disposal has been very successful.<br>Just think how many mediocre pubs there are that miss the tricks Piwna Stopa seems to know intrinsically and maintain. It’s constantly frustrating that because the bar is low (excuse the pub) people refuse to aim high. <br>This place clearly had ambitions to run a pub worthy of shouting about and I’m pleased to say their ambitions have been realised. It is a classic example of how to open and run a good pub, and if I lived in Poznan I would be found drinking in here several times a week. The only shame is I don’t, so I must leave this pleasure for your own exploration and that of the locals.",

The stuff is nationally famous, as is Bamberg’s tradition for beer brewing.<br>One thing therefore you wouldn’t expect from their brewery would be a small-medium sized pub area, but that is precisely what you get. That’s not a criticism though, the pub is absolutely fantastic, in comparison to many other breweries who go in for cavernous beer halls and at times a far more corporate business-like approach to style and service.<br>There is a luxury to be had bathing in stereotypes from time to time, and the medieval charms of Schlenkerla’s tap house are so distinct and powerful as to make a lasting impression.<br>The exterior of the pub is a traditional fachwerk house, as could be expected, with the classic Scherlenka motif on the lantern outside. Turn left as you walk in to enter the pub, with Schlenkerla beer served gravity pulled from the barrel. The interior is black beamed with medium sized communal seating, and is so appealling on a winter’s day no British qualms about finding your own table come into play. Find a space and place yourself there – perhaps be polite to ask first, but it’s unlikely anyone will decline. The serving wench is stodgy and middle aged, which suits the place perfectly, and your beer will arrive in short order. Keep the bar mat handy as she will be keeping tabs via pencil marks on that. <br>The rauchbier fills your mouth at first with smoke and bacon flavour, nearly overwhelming, but once it has laid the flavour there, the drinking becomes ever milder, with the marzen being a sweetish nut brown ale, with that background smoke and a refreshing hoppy finish. Similar to Guinness, once you overcome the initially strange flavour there is a fantastic drink to be had. <br>The pub area is very cosy and friendly, with many traditional pub staples, even a serving hatch with a stained glass window, and a door leading to a courtyard of high medieval design where one can get fresh air and nosey around at the terrific venue.<br>Although they serve food in the pub area, there is also a cloistered beer hall and restaurant for slightly more formal dining. The styling inches even further towards medievalism without going over the top as with some themed-restaurants. <br>Schlenkerla serve food built to withstand the power of a smoked beer, and the offerings are intensely flavoured and agricultural. The Bamberger sausage is charred black, comes on a spartan metal plate and will make your breath stink for weeks. It’s delicious. The Bamberg Zwiebel is a giant onion stuffed with mince. You get the idea. You can even push the boat out and order Schlenkerla’s doppelbock beer, the combination of complex strong beer and smoked effect pushing the boundaries of what a tongue can cope with.<br>All venues that see a high volume of traffic can result in the service being a little jaded and that also applies to Schlenkerla. I got the impression the majority are well meaning but they certainly seem to tire as the day goes along.<br>As a pub I would recommend this all day long – it is one of the finest pubs I’ve ever been to and I wince with regret that we haven’t developed Star Trek type transporters so I can visit every week.",

The understated pride with which they carry out their jobs is sometimes overlooked but it is worth acknowledging and all adds to the overall feel of the place.<br>The venue is largely set up for communal bench seating, which fills up quite quickly around lunch hours, and bar a lull in the afternoon, becomes fairly busy from early evening onwards.

You never know what might be in store. <br>Additionally, Max Bahnson has advised that U Cerneho Vola are run essentially non-for-profit and a huge portion of the money they make goes towards social projects.

Gázfröccs in Sopron and Csillag EzPresszó in Győr both prove that the bar has been raised. Roncsbár in Hungary’s 2nd city Debrecen, is the most convincing example yet that it’s worth leaving Hungary’s megacity to explore the nightlife in the provinces.<br><br>While I love an old boozer, such as Wichmann’s in Budapest, it must be said the standards of décor, atmosphere and amenities in Hungarian pubs have shot up dramatically since Szimpla et al arrived on the scene. Roncsbár (Roncs, meaning Wreck) immediately showed that its up to the task.<br><br>Established 2013, Roncs is both a cosy pub, a concert hall, a garden terrace and a arty streetfood courtyard, delivering the alluring appeal we love about ruin bars – a combination of rooms to explore as well as cosy areas to congregate. Unlike unsuccessful attempts to export these to the West, it doesn’t feel the least bit corporate, even when you add bouncers and plastic cups (we’ll get to that in a minute).<br>There is no shortage of ways to spend your evening here, whether that be for a quiet drink, for food, for music and partying, or games. What’s better, the bar is designed in such a way that it never feels like those people are clashing with each other.<br><br>While not as enormous as the likes of the Fogas Ház ‘party complex’ or the ruined mansion of Szimpla, there is a fair expanse of space, and just like those it’s exciting to walk through it all for the first time.<br><br>Entering via the front door of the pub, you could be fooled for thinking that’s all there is. It is very pleasant – nothing negative to report – the area is focused on drinks and socialising rather than food – fine by me. You’ll find exposed brick and slightly ramshackle wooden tables. The ceiling appears to be studded with cymbals from drum kits (or was I wrong?). There’s a lively atmosphere and if that was it, then Roncsbár would probably warrant inclusion on our website as an 8/10 pub.<br><br>But after you’ve taken in the indoors, have a wander around and look for a side door – this will take you into the entrance way for the ruin-pub aspect proper. The design suddenly explodes into an eclectic whirlwind of bric-a-brac and, if you pay attention, some finely-crafted artwork. The cherry on top of the cake is, in this case, a wrecked (get it?!) aeroplane which looks like it has been hung, interior contents an all, to the inside of the roof.<br><br>What’s better, is this is heated in the icy winter and well-ventilated, keeping the place comfortable at all times.<br><br>Carry on past the stalls to find a courtyard seating area which will appeal to anyone wanting to watch some sport (big screen, of course) and a terrace garden area – closed on my visit due to the snowy weather – but definitely a further area to spread out in spring and summer. Barbecue? Yes please.<br><br>Drinks are about on standard with most Hungarian bars, however their website boasts they have their own-label beer from Rendelkezik (Reindeer?) which I must admit I didn’t see. It’s still possible to get a standard lager for a fair price and nothing here, be it beer, wine or spirits will offend most local or foreign wallets. If you’re outside you will be made to drink it in a plastic cup – on the upside no-one has to worry about broken glass.<br><br>Service can be a bit rushed and impersonal in that way all popular places end up being, but that isn’t a reason to mark this place down.<br><br>Unlike Budapest, there really is only one place like this in Debrecen, certainly making it stand out. There will always be one or two people of a contrary or conservative nature who take a dislike to these bars. You can’t please all of the people all of the time, but Roncsbár comes pretty damn close.<br><br>I love being able to dip in and out of events that are happening, be able to get some fresh air, or have a sit down, and still be in the same place, and still have something interesting to look at.<br><br>Please note that Debrecen has a very lively, albeit dispersed nightlife and there are several pubs of a very different style that are also worth visiting. Please see HERE.<br><br>There are only a few bars that have earned our 10/10 score, and so congratulations goes to Roncsbár. Long live the Wreck!",

Should you wish to do that shopping thing, Päffgen isn't that far past the bit of town where that sort of stuff goes on. You could walk it. It's only about 1 km from the station/cathedral. (For lazy gits: from Hauptbahnhof U5 two stops to Friesenplatz.)<br><br>I try to do my background research when writing these guides and there is material aplenty about Cologne. I have learnt that I am not alone in my admiration for Päffgen Kölsch. There are plenty of local fans for both it and Malzmühle (another favourite of mine). Taking the Kölsch-konvenzion seriously, this is the type of beer you would expect to get. Light, but quite bitter and aromatically hoppy. Very, very drinkable. The tiny glasses can be frustrating when you get a bit of a thirst going.<br><br>I always dread this bit. How the bloody hell do I think of a new way to tell you lot about the white pine tops to the tables? Is there a new twist to the wood panelling? The oak barrels in the corridor spouting Kölsch - is there anything you haven't already heard me say extolling the virtues of this method of serving beer? No. I think that I've used up my thesaurus for brewpub/ brewery tap/ ausschank or whatever. Päffgen is a very good example of a traditional Rhineland brewpub. The brewery is there for everyone to see, joined to the pub by a roofed-in courtyard. If you've been in one of these places, you'll know exactly what to expect inside. Half pigs roasted. Sacks of potatoes fried. And served on one plate.<br><br>It was founded in 1883, at the height of the \"Gründerzeit\".<br><br>I hope that I don't upset local chauvinists when I say: it's as good as being in Düsseldorf\"",

Overall it's a good look and has a bit of a distinctive character. Beers are carefully curated with a balance between cask, keg + bottle offerings along with a few ciders. For the size of the place it's a reasonable selection. Before Brexit + Covid they used to boast 64 different bottles behind the bar, lots from Belgium. That is reduced but it's still pretty good. With quiz nights, open mic, board games and books, this is a place to hang loose, and has its own community of people. Terrific atmosphere at times both at warmer and colder times of year. A real classic of its genre. (Added 2020)",

Very well rated so far which speaks for its kitchen output too. The main appeal however is of a lively vibrant social scene that choose this place and Na Srebaku over the road to socialise. Highly recommended to get a tram out here for them both. (added October 2021)",

The bar room is perhaps the most basic and traditional, but the lounge with its fireplace and striking artwork is impressive too. The backrooms with games and more intimate space come alive at busier times and shouldn't be missed. Ossett Brewery owns the place and most of the beer offerings stem from them, all of which are excellently well kept. A great selection of pub snacks - pies, pasties, rolls, scotch eggs from local suppliers, all at fair prices.

The place itself is a curated work of art with each room and each corner carefully put together piece by piece. A long narrow bar is a natural congregation area, with pleasant niches around it which generate the hubbub and energy that make the pub really shine. Even TV with sport can't really split opinion as the venue does so well balancing each need. Covered outdoor seating and food help to supply further reasons for coming. Simply put, a classic pub.

These contain a healthy range of domestic and European lagers and, for some reason or other, an association with O'Hara's ale in Ireland. Pub grub is served to accompany this but is in no way obligatory. With a social, communal focus, the atmosphere is built around conversation, and in that sense everything feels alive, at home and at one here. A must-visit. (added April 2022)",

Intimate and characterful, your needs will be met and then some. Sit by the fire, enjoy the pub dog George tottering about and design your next hike that coincides with this place. A classic.

Since then we've been back a few times and it has crept up the pecking order each time (partly through the closures of others like Instant, Kuplung, Ellato Kert) to the extent that we can comfortably call this one of Budapest's top 5 ruin bars. The space itself is a great skeleton on which to design a ruin bar with a wide tree-dotted courtyard surrounded by a tall building enveloping it. From the entrance way to the colourful interior, you'll feel a sense of ease and fun to the place, a balance that allows different groups to do what they would like to do without excluding or annoying others, which given the international flavour of the place is pretty impressive.

Hugely popular with a wide range of people across classes and backgrounds, with locals jealously guarding it, while never making you feel unwelcome. Beer selection is good with a little range of sours and gueuzes for specialist drinkers, and as the sense of institution pervades almost everything about the place, ordering a Bolleke of De Koninck feels appropriate, where it is often said to be among the freshest and best poured in the city.

While it may look like a relic, it remains relevant to locals and provides a handy bolthole for the occasional cyclist group or community event, with a rhythm that very much suggests a presence that projects past a few mouldy old regulars. Easily worth the walk over for views of the dock and a friendly little slice of local life. Drinks are basic, but as this is Belgium, that still means there are some exquisite beers to enjoy.

The drinks selection is varied and the offering more unisex than the average old man boozer, certainly.

If you prize craft beer above all else, you will want to visit here, with its tap options more relevant and contemporary, as well as more varied. However, some of the original concept has fallen by the wayside. A side pour PU tap goes unused along with a few other gimmicks. In its stead, you will be presented with the familiar craft focus on pales, stouts and sours, which makes a change from some of the traditional Antwerp bars - but, let's face it, they aren't exactly bad! A large dog mural outside is iconic as is the tiled floor, yet another venue to preserver that well. In a small two-storey bar atmosphere is huddled but without the exact social element you're looking for, making this a missed opportunity for something great rather than a great bar itself. Constant kitchen smell also interferes with the idea of it as a drinking hole, however it is positioned as an Estaminet and needs to be treated as such, despite the high chairs. (Added July 2022)",

The place has a natural space which promotes socialising and on entering you immediately get the sense that the goings on of the town are never far away from being discussed here. As for the beers, a very competent 11 degree pale lager is the stalwart with their brewing operation producing a few seasonal rotations and specials, which is complimented by 3 or 4 alternatives also from independent small brewers. Which around here is an excellent find. Wines by the bottle reflect this is wine country. A great place and clearly an institution. (added August 2022)",

Several main dishes are served as small portions, there are pub snacks like pies and rolls and they deal with any gradient of hunger. The food isn't dominant as you typically find in rural pubs these days. Tables aren't set, there is no background clutter of cutlery or catering smell. They aren't religious about final orders at 2.30pm (even though it is best not to take the mickey). It keeps going. The ales for a rural pub are impressive. Typical classics complimented by several local and regional cask ales, craft keg with one or two raising an eyebrow - not craft beer bar standard but would shame many city pubs. Prices are all fair given the location and fame for the place. After all this it seems a pointless addendum to mention Dick Turpin, and the association of the highwayman to this place, but if you want to find out more, they'll tell you. It is far from essential to enjoy a pub of this quality. One of the best in England. Visit at once. (Added 2022)",

It can be difficult to know what to make of. For enthusiasts of Medieval architecture, Spon street offers a superb example of a surviving, largely restored row of timber frame houses which are now largely restaurants, with The Old Windmill standing proudly among them. It is fair to call the place an institution, with all that entails. Familiarity, busy trade and an iconic sense that it is as much of the fabric of the city as the Guildhall or Cathedrals. The experience in the Windmill can be surprisingly intimate and almost village like however, split up into several rooms and a snug, you can leave many of the trappings of modern life behind and luxuriate in the simple comforts of a roaring hearth, good ale and good company, at its heart. They boast about their cheese and pasties, host live events and overall provide a versatile space without taking any major backward step in terms of affecting the character of the place. That is to its eternal credit. After all, effective stewardship of a 500 year old pub is not mean feat and we should continue bearing in mind that while the nuts and bolts of the pub are special, it is the people who look after it who make it. It could so easily, as with so many other pubs, have gone wrong. Visit to write your own name into a page of its history, a fabulous pub indeed. (Added November 2022)",

The combination of people is actually complimentary however, bringing a collegiate, friendly vibe. The place is warm, slightly ramshackle and decorated with local art, with some unusual nooks and an internal back yard with a patio and fish tank adding to the ensemble. Drinks are typical if not exceptional but broadly well-catered for its diverse audience from middle aged cafe goers to late night student fare. Compliments are due for an operation that has achieved something not many have, a harmonious balance between the mainstream and alternative. (Added January 2023)",

Nothing you won't have seen before, but nicely curated and very unusual by Croatia's modest standards. Drinks are adequate while the range of amenities is more of a standout here, a versatile place you could sink into the sofa and read a book, or enjoy some sport on TV, lounge out in the garden, catch up with friends or go for a buzzy evening out. Very much worth a look while in Zagreb. (Added April 2023)",

Social chat and banter enhanced by the darts played at the bar. <br>Amenities/Events: ❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>Darts, outdoor seating, smoking permitted, books, snacks<br>Value For Money: ❤️❤️❤️<br>The going rate for the area, nothing scary.<br>description: After the nth nothingy cafe bar you'd be tempted to feel demotivated, to wonder if there actually are any truly epic bars in the Balkans which compete with other regions of Europe. Then, your cursor falls over the next icon with a coffee mug on it, filled with hope but not expectation, you find one. Graffiti, set outside Novi Sad old town in pleasant enough suburbs is easily reachable and well worth the trip - in fact if you are going anywhere near Novi Sad you should pay a visit. Its interior, a labour of love, carefully curated with rich reds, golds and unusual ceiling fittings with vintage photography. With a leafy terrace out front, this has some of the core ingredients for fantastically atmospheric evening bar going. This is enhanced further by its non-touristy location. Those here are acquaintances, familiar faces, and as they play darts by the bar, the chatter is real, local, and the feel is truly authentic. This is their place, and you are merely a welcome guest. Grab one of the little tables and soak up the rich surroundings, the likes of which you'll not be experiencing in the region very often. (Added June 2023)",

Some of our best finds have happened this way and just shows you should never switch off, the next nice bar may be just around the corner! This is a lovely little place set in a precinct between two of the main squares in Novi Sad, and as you approach the fairylights and greenery will appear to you like an oasis of enjoyment of relaxation, not something to walk past, but dive into. The bar is a tiny, alternative-leaning place, dog-friendly, and fascist-unfriendly, with some pro-Yugoslavia stickers around the place. They sell merchandise but manage to do so in a non-annoying way (unlike, for example, BrewDog). Drinks are better than you'd expect from an alt place with Serbian craft beer on tap and bottles and some interesting wines and spirits too, pretty good considering the tiny place. Service is friendly and its a place you could imagine making your local if you lived here. (Added June 2023)",

A little out of the centre but well worth the short walk, you'll find fully neighbourly local life in an interior that will take you aback in its unfamiliarity and distinction from virtually any other bar in hundreds of miles radius.

A long standing venue set off from the core bar areas, without a lot of nearby competition, the end result is it draws in a neighbourly, more local audience. Less chance of encountering middle aged Yanks or British backpackers. Later on the atmosphere descends into drunken revelry. Midsummer parties, table dancing and the bar staff, the nominal adults in the room leading the charge. At its best when busy but perfectly pleasant for a sedate afternoon, this is a very useful option to keep in your pocket, particularly if you're located anywhere near Stradom, Blonia or West of the old town.

Secondly, as it opens at 7pm by which time many day trippers are already setting out to leave. All cities need - and deserve an informal bolthole to let your hair down and have fun, particularly Bamberg with its arch-traditional Wirtshauses. Pizzini darts in like a bolt from the blue with its ramshackle layout and atmosphere more akin to a brown café, Kazimierz bar or Berlin kneipe, a late opening operation servicing people who want to carry on their socialising until the early hours. Truly informal with a particular feeling of verve and vibrance that is very difficult to force. Being Franconia there are of course superb beer options alongside a decent enough suite of alternatives, meaning the product and experience ticks the right boxes. Find a preferred nook among the aging wood fittings, artwork, musical instruments and battered furniture and chat, plot and party until home time. What a bar! (Added August 2023)",

Brush up on the usual Czech pleasantries and you can enjoy a friendly welcome from the young tapster getting rave reviews (and awards, it would seem) and sit among people just having a chat and getting on with their social connections. Very rarely do you encounter trouble in these sorts of places, but of course try to be respectful. The Krusovice (never a favourite of ours) is available across the range for a very good price, and immaculately poured. There was all reason to stay there and have more beers, whether in the intimate, clandestine taproom or the lounge which oozes with age and character (and a giant projector screen, it must be said). A quirky, loveable option that a portion of our readers will love, and many will either detest or be too scared to try. (Added August 2023)",

Such a collection is not easily copied or repeated, neither is it integrated into a bar with such ease. It is simply one of the standout venues in Europe to attempt something like this. WWII memorabilia, belle epoque cocktail menus, grotesque giant busts, model train sets, large oil paintings, billiard tables and much more besides provide an experience that is as distracting as it is intense, more still when their old fashioned cocktails slip down.

Out with the pretension and petty megalomania, and in with making nice beer and fostering a community of people. With a clear collegiate, international flavour without losing  any of its Lisboa character, you'll find a garage on a hill, tucked away, which feels like a hidey hole from the hustle of the city. Inside anything will be going on from brewing, live music, projected live events, board games, books, computer games or off-sales of brewing equipment and materials. Very likeable as a result.

For a start, we are very central in Porto at this point, an area in the city where wholesome working class businesses are dying out fast following inundations of tourists and fly-by-night Americans coming to work remotely. The prospect of finding such a place these days without venturing further out is becoming remote. Then the prices - rub your eyes, rub them again. Yes, in 2023 the sight of a sign advertising a litre of wine for 2 euros, whatever the wine may be, is certainly eye catching. A beer for a Euro, a Ginja for 50 cents? Really. Alfredo Portista serves petiscos (snacks) as well as full meals, petinga ( tiny sardines) or bacalhau with arroz de couve ( cabbage rice) or rojões (fried pork with potatoes). Snacks include Bifana, a famous Portuguese fast food dish - flash fried steak in a bun. Mingling among the locals, soaking up the rhythm and atmosphere of an unspoilt pub with a firm identity and a sense that it's going nowhere anytime soon. Let's hope that stays the case.

The club aspect is maintained with a bell at the door. You will be greeted then ushered in. The bar is to your left, well stocked with a good range of beer, including Belgian bottles and a competent back bar. Move through to a large seating area with eye catching engraved wainscotting, wooden panels on the ceiling and chandeliers, the walls festooned with sporting memorabilia. There is a typically high Victorian romance too with its Roman columns, all a bit more than you'd expect. The sporting aspect is maintained with scheduled events displayed on a projector and a series of pool tables to the rear of the room. They host gatherings from various community groups and have an attendant DJ on some nights too. In the end they achieve something for everyone without making the offering too jarring or too diluted, which is to its credit. (Added September 2023)",

Then, around 2009 it was taken over by a brewery and with a committed emphasis on cleaning it up, improving the drinks offering without removing the character. Since then, it has attained the status of local classic, a place anyone in North London might think about taking the train to visit (and it is in a triangle of 3 available stops). On a row of shops by a railway bridge, as you approach there is a timeless since of permanence to the exterior. It has changed, it has received a lick of paint, but the function overall has not. Here you will find exclusively beer and cider from independent breweries, often small and in need of this kind of platform. Spit n sawdust type floors, pew seating and old signage is balanced by the large front mirror, and a café vibe at the front known as 'Cockney corner' after the stalwarts who decided to stay. At the back in the garden, poets corner describes the vaguely Bohemian, if middle class crowd. In the evenings the place becomes busy and buzzy, finding a seat a matter of ruthless opportunism, but not impossible if you give it 10-15 minutes usually. During the day the worn wood and general ambience endows the place with a classy charm not unlike a brown café of Belgium or Netherlands. One of the highlights of pubgoing in North London.

The interior comes into its own in the evening but has a certain youthful energy during the afternoon too with a free jukebox and lively staff keeping the rhythm going. Although drinks are limited here, they play only a supporting role to what is an experience pub. (Added September 2023)",

Two fireplaces at either side of the opened-out main room maintain cosiness, with communal seating around it. This pub is for drinking and socialising, not dining, although their pies and pasties are very good. Characterful rooms including the backroom which is largely unchanged from its former owners.

Very few Baltic bars honestly feel like an institution, but this place feels more of an institution than many English pubs, which really underscores how special it is. (Added November 2023)",

As far as beer goes, very strong. Basic back bar for alternatives and café style options.<br>Style/Décor: ❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>Tucked in a courtyard, a sign outside cryptically suggests it's open when it's open and closed when it's closed. Enter to find a small vaulted room with fireplace and lounge style furniture. The curved ceilings decorated with bank notes around the world, and there's a fish tank on a ledge. <br>Atmosphere/Character: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>Supremely cosy in the winter months with the fire going in the intimate vaulted space. Set down with a nice beer and company, you will not want to leave.<br>Amenities/Events: ❤️❤️❤️<br>Pizza (only some nights), bottle shop, fireplace, books, board games, occasional events, limited outdoor seating in summer.<br>Value For Money: ❤️❤️❤️<br>Surprisingly fair value given the central location. While not cheap by Eastern European standards it certainly competes with local ones. <br>description: Plainly called \"Koht\", or 'place' in Estonian, but also known as Golden Lion (after the building) or Moonshine Bar, you'll need to head into a courtyard to spot the door to the corner of the place. It's hardly a hidden bar, but those easily confused may need some reassurance that yes, that black door is the entrance to the bar. Inside you'll find a small space inside old vaults with a real fire in the corner, fish tank on a ledge and comfortable lounge seating. In winter (6 months a year in Tallinn) it's a supremely cosy spot with limited seating, but we found no difficulty on any of the 3 occasions finding a spot to sit. The beer selection is excellent with 8 or so taps covering local beer to European classics, with an adjoining bottle shop which expands the range further. There is no doubt this occupies the vast majority of the purpose of the bar, but there are alternatives and the bar retains a slight hint of café to it as a result. Simply an unmissable stop off when in the city. (Added November 2023)",

Maintained immaculately, there are so few signs of wear and tear it feels like it could have opened last week. A central bar which strongly resembles The Old Joint Stock in Birmingham or The Old Bank of England in London with a stack rising and drawing your eyes towards a marvellous stained glass ceiling. The pub is galleried in that familiar fashion with levels and niches to choose from. The rest of the concept is familiar - decent grub and decent beer, with the addition of their own beers which add a further point of interest.  While it is outside the old centre, it is easily reached on the main road between the airport and centre and should be strongly considered. It is also warm and well-heated during winter. (Added November 2023)",

However, we may be able to keep you hooked with the promise that this is not your average Medieval themed restaurant with huge dining halls, faux heraldry and impossible platters of meat. Instead, you'll find a surprisingly small, simply middle ages inn, two stone-walled, candlelit rooms with simple seating and a simple concept. Two women staff the bar and kitchen, one serving drinks and food, the other cooking. You order and collect direct from them, then take your wares to a table of your choice. The interior is suitably gloomy and almost hysterically rustic and cro-magnon in its approach. Food orders are spartan - Elk broth, sausages with gherkin you fish out of an upturned barrel, and ribs - that's more or less it - you can buy carrot and other veg separately. The beer comes in two options - light or dark and the price is described always as \"moneys\" rather than Euros. There are some unfortunately unavoidably cheesy/tourist elements but the core of the experience remains sound - candles, beer, stone, wood, warmth and cheer. (Added November 2023)",

The low beams, fireplaces and traditional tables place you in an idyllic, supremely cosy rural setting. With a range of Yorkshire ales on cask, bookshelf with plenty of local interest, dog friendly approach, terrace for summer days, and straight talking welcome from the staff, there is a quintessentially Yorkshire feel to the place. A throwback but one that is still busy and beloved. (Added February 2024)",

The pub has a long history, transformed from the Volunteer Arms by the Kerr family who were local whisky blenders, operating in the cellar of the pub for a time on their 'The Golden Drop'. James Kerr was a very particular fellow and the pub was always run to a set of rules both according to customers and even his staff, which is why some people truly take against the place. However, you will need to visit with an open mind, as there is an exquisite pub to be enjoyed. Rich reds, creams and lacquered wood around lamplight, nooks and crannies festooned with personal artefacts, books, heritage art and always something to draw the eye, whether it's the dummy fastened to the ceiling in the lounger or the huge Nebuchadnezzer wine bottles perched on the shelves. Unless you're a regular, service is only tolerant at best, but once served, enjoy your drinks in this wonderful environment that would draw you back often enough that you too could have the rare privilege of being seen as a treasured customer.

A strong beer selection will always make this a go-to for many, including even an up to date keg selection of modern beers, along with many cask ales from smaller independent brewers. Trade is brisk and the atmosphere can get lively, but there is a slight feeling the opened out cavernous nature of it moves the ambience further towards a Wetherspoons than would be ideal. Nevertheless, there remains plenty to enjoy. (Added February 2024)",

The British pub was a format often used and the idea that this would provide a civilised space for social drinking that tempered excess proved to be effective. These days it is among the oldest continually running pub operations in Finland. You'd never spot this from the outside with its unprepossessing glass frontage offering barely any hint of what's inside. As you enter however, you will be transported into an almost unchanged simulacra of a British pub from the early 1970s, all brown hues, carved wood, brewing signage and mirrors, with darts, pool and a piano. The Anglophilia extends to occasional supply of fresh cask ales and British ales on keg too. But don't take this as being a themed pub - far from it. The length of time this has been open has endowed it with a particular character of its own, the events it has hosted, the stories it can tell push this far beyond the realm of some tacky theme establishment. The natural ambience whether late afternoon, or in the bustle of a winter evening is extraordinary. If it was located in London itself there is no doubt it could be classed among the very best traditional pubs in the city. As for Finland, it is certainly belongs the rarified air of the upper echelons. The darts and pool particularly give the place an easy casual nature which disarms the sometimes staid nature of Finnish pub going (excluding karaoke bars), the drinks are perhaps last-gen but will serve you well. It isn't especially cheap but you will have to suck it up on this occasion to experience one of the finest pubs in Europe. (Added March 2024)",

The blue and salmon pink decoration inside will make those who made the journey nostalgic for the area. Tåget now joins the list of venues repurposed from former use in Turku.<br><br>It is, for reasons both accidental and purposeful, a great experience. <br><br>This side of the tracks in Turku is awaiting the usual redevelopment and gentrification, so for now, the cast of patrons is an interesting mix from punk/bohemian dropouts to middle aged families, with plenty in between.  The atmosphere in the carriage therefore feels like a journey, if rather over time than space. Kick back and have a game of chess or head over to the \"pretentious\" seats at the back which Janne has set up for a slightly different vibe.<br><br>Once full up, the intimacy is added to by the sense of transgression - should this be happening in a train carriage? There is a faintly end-of-days atmosphere as though we are hiding from zombies or air strikes, which on top of the superficial novelty factor makes this bar an extremely distinctive experience - not only for Finland, which is short on such places, but Europe in general.

A lobby area with booth seating opposite the brewkit serves as the bar room, with several lounges spread around it, and a beer garden to the rear of the building. Upstairs is an enormous banqueting hall, the Bellman Hall which used to host gym class. There is much to explore and feel free to, as the sense of belonging grows as you start to realise you can be at ease here, there are no security staff to enforcer cordons or people who will chastise you for being in the wrong place, and that adds to its likeability.<br><br>The brewery focuses on lagers which are in general a notch above the ordinary without really touching on superb, but their seasonal specials and one-offs also show plenty of creativity, and being Finland, the effort goes into keeping everything fresh and clean. <br><br>Grab a brew and enjoy the feeling of being in a historic institution - keep an eye on the weekday buffet offering too.

Several such bars remain and Harry's is arguably one of them. Being a short walk from the central station makes this an achievable target for anyone seeking the experience, but we recommend doing so after dusk falls, when the atmosphere takes on a different colour. Set in a half-step basement, there is already a feel of clandestine activity as you set foot in the bar. A comfortable lounge area awaits with red upholstery, lamp light and net curtains offering a kind of caught-in-time atmosphere. As the evening progresses, with 2am closing, this kind of timeless hangout is where to find the true social activity in the city, not so much the upright beer destinations. Drinks are cheap and cheerful, (minus the cheap - it's Helsinki) and merely provide the lubrication for the socialising. (Added March 2024)",

As you approach you'll note the somewhat territorial pavement dwellers doing some pretty intense people watching, but it becomes instantly relaxed and convivial once you take your seat inside. Staff are friendly and the atmosphere is European, that is to say, Basel being on the corner of 3 countries makes it very international in flavour. With music, board games, bistro style food and enough space to accommodate all these different needs, it is time to appreciate the deft way this venue pulls all these things together, particularly in an age when business ideas are so ruthlessly discriminatory towards specific audiences. Yes, this is located in Klein-Basel, the Clara district which is a younger, less staid area of the city centre, and Flore is at the apex of the post-grad social scene onwards. Be warned though: CASH ONLY.<br><br>(Added March 2024)",

In the building of a former brewery Neumayer whose signage is still visible outside (in disarmingly good condition), it has houses a restaurant, club and jazz bar across storied decades of the 20th Century. The operation Atlantik has existed since 1984 with a focus on providing cultural events and good food and drink at a fair price. The interior is charmingly battered, immediately putting you in mind of a Zizkov dive bar, with a congregation of students and grizzled elderlies, with a few in between here for a cheap meal or the events - which unusually emphasize slam poetry! Atlantik provides employment for refugees and this is sometimes shown in the excellent cooking, although it can naturally make it a little more disorganised at times. The drinks selection is altogether pretty decent too, with enough variation to keep one amused, although craft beer fans may find it a little last-gen, because the focus is on domestic wares and traditional German styles. With a fantastic atmosphere and ease to the place that you can experience day or night, this is a must visit for anyone who doesn't turn their noses up at a scuzzy dive bar. (Added March 2024)",

Then pay for your beer, and you'll receive a voucher, which you hand over with your stein at the beer counter, and the stein is returned to you, full and foaming. Then take your place among the many rooms which flank a long food court where canteen dishes help soak up the booze. Beer is served direct from the wooden barrel and designed to be smooth and highly attenuated - that is to say, drinkable. <br><br>Highly unusually, food can be brought in. Thus people have always brought wooden cutting boards for the food, cutlery, napkins, bacon, cheese and pickles in  picnic baskets. This is a complex with a close connection to the Benedictine order of monks who converted the venue from an army barracks in the 19th century. 5,000 square metres floor space is considered the largest establishment of its kind in Austria.

Not somewhere you'd take your partner out to dinner, but there is a charm to its endurance and an stubbornness to be enjoyed in its utter refusal to bend to the latest whim. As usual, you'll find a host of characters who may look a bit scary, but are all there for a chat and a laugh. Knowing a few Czech phrases will serve you very well in such places! Just as the country is well known for its breweries and big city beer halls, a pub like this couldn't be more typical and couldn't give you more of a flavour of working class pub going in the country. Fair value for basic goods, darts and a fully laid back hangout. It squeaks onto our guide. (Added April 2024)",

They could use the support of a broader clientele, but let's focus on the positives. The knajpa style taproom on entry is a glorious throwback, and the beer you'll be poured, Platan from Protivin is presented pristinely, for a price that competes among the lowest in the entire country. The elderly tapster knows a thing or two about how to pour a beer, let's just say that. Through a partition is the lounge which has a relaxed atmosphere during the day, but is certainly worth exploring later to see if it picks up pace. As such a survivor, it is well-worth checking out while in Pisek and more charming than some of the modernised places down the road such as Na Sadech. (Added April 2024)",

Although the interior is plain and would benefit from some personalising for its own identity, the sheer vibrancy, neighbourhood atmosphere and total departure and absence of tourists makes this at the time of writing somewhat of a hidden gem.

Good beer from independent breweries can be found here along with the typical Czech back bar, while the atmosphere is also distinctive.

Of the three mentioned above, this one is still bedding in, but has plenty of potential. Purposefully retro in a First Republic style, there is genteel detail in an otherwise minimalist setup with chunky tables and a knajpa feel around the bar.

But this ain't no museum (Although it remains interesting to look at that way), but a bar that is vibrant, relevant and exudes the kind of energy, conviviality and values you're looking for in a neighbourhood boozer. Due to the location in El Clot, you won't find this place overrun with tourists but instead there's a healthier blend - mainly locals and a few foreign residents with the odd tourist tagging along. What's the bar all about then? Well, order a plate or two of tapas and grab a beer of vermouth (or wine) to enjoy these with. Everything is set up simply and straightforwardly, commanded by a duo of assertive but engaging and friendly women. For some reason even the presence of an arcade machine slap bang in the middle of the bar alters nothing of the experience or character of the place. If you've been peering at some old grainy photos online of a quiet Bodega from back in 2011 or something, think again and prepare yourself for one of the city's finest buzziest bar experiences.

What meets the eye isn't all original though, but a carefully curated ensemble of original fittings and recovered items which date from around the era it was constructed. A wide bar off a terrace instantly makes a good impression with its beautiful carved wood, after which you will be shown to a table. A compact menu of their house cocktails will help focus your mind, each of which produced with a satisfactory degree of élan without going over the top. The service does make this place more formal than usual for Spain, but among the bar space itself the atmosphere is chatty rather than private. The energy and thus the conviviality increases as evening progresses, turning a café atmosphere into a late bar. Along with the cocktails a kitchen produces some interesting stuff. Highly recommended. (Added May 2024)",

The Burgundy Snail is duly painted in rich red, with its diagram taking up the wall space adjacent to the bar, in case you needed to know what the name meant. A famous, award-winning historic venue with a line in bustling singalongs and a lack of personal space usually reserved for popular tapas bars in Seville. Yes, if you dislike either of those, I would steer clear. For the rest however, it is worth joining the throng for an atmosphere entirely unlike you'll find somewhere like England, either because you're into that, or because the novelty value is sky high. Sip on little beers and munch on plates of Dutch tapas (beige buffet) trying not to clatter into people as the surge of song and good cheer rides through the pub like a wave. Apparently there are quieter times too? Well, who'd have thunk it! (Added June 2024)",

Inspired by the tales of HP Lovecraft, the interior - if a tinge too 'theme bar' does a good job of placing you in the environment of a Victorian study. The waiter will approach and guide you to an absinth of your choosing. Generally they slide towards tasting more like Pastis or more like bitter wormwood. The water decanter will be set up, and you are left enjoying the drink in a rather opulent, hedonistic and ever so slightly macabre scene. Just as they intended then!

Unlike Dutch Jenever, Pekets are mixed a little differently, resulting in a slightly longer drink. Like Jenever, this can be adulterated to virtually any flavour under the sun. But what about the venue? Set in a characterful old townhouse, the pubby bar area is very much set up for drinking and socialising with an increasingly young vibe as the night progresses. The interior is kept reasonably in keeping with the natural environment of the building with exposed brickwork and suitable signage, which leans on its history somewhat, without ever becoming staid. Are there times where this may become a little bit too towny? Probably, but this is the nature of the beast. Lastly, do not be confused by the restaurant  Amon Nanesse that shares the building and is in effect the same operation. (Added June 2024)",

The loud frontage with its psychedelic title screams at you to give it a try. The passion is for natural wines, and a recommendation is very easy to acquire. You'll be drinking in a tiny, personalised bunker, a shrine to wine, if you like. It feels like it has been open since forever but is actually a product of the late 00s. The venue acquired notoriety for hosting parties long into the night, even operating without a bar license (it was technically a shop), allowed smoking, among other fights with the authorities. Set in the now buzzing Rue des Filatiers, it could hardly accept sole responsibility for noise pollution given virtually every business on the street is turning into a bar or eatery. For French flair of an old-school variety, here is the place to go. If you associate wine with social climbing, to be seen and be seen, or have any pretense in that regard, steer well clear, so the rest of us can enjoy this idiosyncratic, grumpy old survivor.

It wears that relatively lightly, content to flow with the tide rather than self-mythologise (at least so long as you avoid social media accounts). The place is superbly understated, lacking the pretense and social-climbing generica of many wine bars that people like us find off-putting.  It is a place to meet up, relax, socialise and prefers to set the environment to an informal, atmospheric setting. The place is decorated in a stripped back, bohemian way, a one-room joint with a little space to mill about on the front. Their speciality is natural wines, and the menu is pared back, making a decision easier, and emphasising quality over quantity. Typically French with a cross section of people counting from students, amateur philosophers, artists, romantic couples and anyone else looking to enjoy a spectacularly good wine for a nice price in an environment that oozes charm and atmosphere.

Inside is a thin cosy space well fitted with globe lamps, wood fittings and signage of the era. It is nice to see a vision brought to life with this level of panache. However, it isn't simply a museum, with TV, outdoor space, meals, modern beers and enough amenities to draw in different crowds. This must explain the great reviews. Definitely one to keep in mind as it conveniently links the city centre with the Baltic Triangle or Georgia quarter if you are doing a pub crawl. (Added July 2024)",

An old Bodega with the typical hulking wine barrels adjacent to the bar, and long shelf of bottles speaks to its shop/takeaway format, but this is a social meeting hub, not only for mealtimes but any time either side of siesta. A characterful and ultra non-bullshit double act work the front, an organised, snappy and lithe woman (who seems to be doing more than her fare share in all honest) and a shambling, but nonetheless willing portly gent who looks like he sleeps under the barrels after work. There is no menu, and that is where things get interesting. Unfortunately as often happens in Spain, you find out what is available by asking, not always easy if your Spanish stops at jamon, queso, cerveza. Hang on, wait - in all honesty that is probably enough. They largely deal with meat, cheese and bread, which is pretty much ideal to go with the wines and a few bottles of beer. However, if you're in a group you can order hot dishes - on our last visit a cauldron of bubbling snails was produced for the gents sitting next to us. This isn't half the story though - this is a full on balls to the wall boozer with single guys draining carafes of wine straight into their mouth, couples chatting noisily between mouthfuls and a certain something to the atmosphere. Let's say, a shameless dedication to consumption and socialising that lifts it way beyond most of their local rivals, something you won't find at the more touristy, middle-class venues.

A Bodega in name and in deed, this is somewhere you can purchase wine for home consumption, and they do takeaways for fans of their food too. Cold plates of tapas and all manner of nuts, beans, etc are on offer to enjoy alongside the many wines on offer in the bar. A neighbourhood crowd of families and friends keep the show on the road, but there is a feeling that outside of the family rituals it doesn't see as much young custom as it could, compared to the likes of El Labrador down the road. That is a damn shame, but at least we're here to sing its praises. Oh, and while we're at it, the place is superbly good value. (Added July 2024)",

They boast a cellar of 500 wines meaning no wine drinker is going to want for much, but what is more interesting is they are mainly available by the glass, which is pretty special. I often find plenty to criticise about wonderful places that have been slightly spoiled by commercialising, as this has - the boastful promotional material about balancing tradition and modernity in harmony is a little self-satisfied and doesn't ring true entirely.  However, it is important to balance those disappointments against the quality that is there. There is no doubt it is among the best venues in the city, even if it is drifting towards haute-bourgeoisie and tourism in its approach. (Added July 2024)",

It isn't all disappointing though, as service from the owner's wife is friendly and helpful, they have their own brewing operations and the general selection of drinks is strong. As you'll be exploring the alleyways of beautiful Split old town, a place like this is handy to have up your sleeve. Bittersweet though, like an IPA. (Added August 2024)",

The beer selection is very strong here on cask, keg and bottles, competing with most places across Norwich. The pub lacks the grab-me factor of the Alexandra, Fat Cat or White Lion but it is friendly, welcoming and neighbourly and still comes firmly recommended. (Added August 2024)",

Sweet because they have a good reputation for preserving historic taverns, bitter because their operation, what goes on within the pub, tends to homogenise places which deserve their own distinct character.<br><br>Although this 'chain churn' (dinner plates, old glasses, etc) is mildly to its detriment, as is the high pricing, it doesn't dampen proceedings overly. Think of a drink as part of the entrance fee to a living museum.<br><br>Being central, bustling and famous usually ends up with the word 'institution' being trotted out, but rarely can that word be better applied than to this place, its daily rhythms as much part of Belfast than any other aspect, including those to cause upset and violence.

A long and impressive list of taps provides a selection that can compete with anywhere in the city, with a European bias but not beyond craft selections either. These are averagely priced but there are some real standouts during happy hour to pay attention to. An unpretentious knockabout sort of place where you can turn around and find a new person to talk to. Pinball and darts in the side room, event space in the back, and a cosy set of communal tables down a long narrow central bar make this an exciteable, popular and versatile social venue that nails most of the qualities of bars aside pretense and artifice. It might not be a place to take a first date (although, being Reims, you can still purchase Champagne by the glass), but it is a place to hang out in, relax and have fun, all the better for offering very nice drinks.

Lille however, lost those to the 'Estaminet', owned by a company who insist all customers dine there, therefore disqualifying them from being seen as pubs. Thank heavens for L'illustration, that keeps the Nouveau elegant cosy café alive and well. It is no surprise to see this is the work of a bucolic eccentric, whose character is as much a part of the café as its rickety fixtures and fittings - no joke, mind your head on the staircase. With space at a premium, sashaying between chairs clutching goblets of delicious beer from the likes of De Ranke, or glasses of curated bio/natural wines is par for the course when visiting here. It will not escape your attention this is a popular place where real estate is guarded carefully by locals, but as a newcomer you will receive a genial welcome nevertheless. Take care to explore the upstairs also, and dream of a life where you get to visit this café regularly, your local home from home. If you use Lille Europe while travelling by Eurostar, then make a beeline for this place, despite the extra 5-10 minutes walk it will take you. (Added November 2024)",

Easily reachable via Trebovice tram line, but once you're here you will feel a long way way from the old town (and in more than one sense, you are).<br><br> A brewery with a high reputation in the region, they focus evenly between traditional Czech styles and modern ales, with around 4/5 on tap here at any one time. <br><br>The interior is simple, but warm and cosy, a social setup where the emphasis is on socialising far more than it is about sampling. The interior could use a bit more personalising and identity, but at least they haven't fallen for the same stereotypical craft bar look. Meanwhile, the social scene here ensures a good atmosphere if you arrive at the right time. Although it does slant towards a younger audience there is no particular reason why older generations shouldn't give this place a try, as it combines a number of timeless virtues. Oh, and the prices are rather fair too. (Added November 2024)<br>",

That is very much on display at the brewery, as you round a corner to be confronted by a large yellow grain silo, modern branding and a fairly sleek looking operation. Inside however, country comforts away, with a traditionally decorated Gaststatte type dining hall and taproom. Acres of trees gone into the wood fittings, with quirky elements like the tiled stove adding to the atmosphere. <br><br>The taproom is clearly the place to be, but unfortunately they allow reservations rather than using that limited space as a casual social space, and the dining area for reservations and food. That is room for improvement. <br><br>Pricing is ambitious for a rural Czech brewery, clocking in at only OK considering you are purchasing the beer direct from the site, and the food menu likewise. It is a good job both food and beer are high quality.<br><br>Their lagers certainly compete with some of the best in the region, with an equal, if not greater focus on ales. This gives reason to stay and explore the range.<br><br>I can recommend using this place for a middle or end stop after a hike in the surrounding hills, to Lysa Hora for example. The atmosphere inside has that feel of wandering hikers, a slightly heady feel of everyone having travelled here to get away from it all. <br><br>As it's only 30-40 minutes from Ostrava with a straight forward train journey, this should give plenty of pause for thought. We can recommend the place.<br><br>(Added October 2024)",

Gobelinka has been going since the 1960s producing and restoring tapestries, opening a museum and gallery, exhibiting the making and heritage of original works. That gallery spills over into this pub, café, culture centre with a garden out front and large, but cosy space inside. Live music, quiet corners for reading, social meeting space, they do it here at this distinctive, versatile venue. It's a shame the town is such a pain to get to, but then sometimes that's also what helps make such experiences special. Catch the venue on a busy evening and you'll be googling local real estate prices the morning after. (Added November 2024)",

The Railway theme bursts forth - this is no shrine to minimalism. Cute, twee, but cosy and very social, as an introduction to the Danish pub it represents one of the most vivid as well as a high watermark in general. Your eyes will dance across the room at the displays, from the wall of nik-naks to an operating train set, nothing is left to chance. Rich loungey reds decorate the room, each seating space designed to maximise room for customers. There is a cheerful verve to the place at any time of day with customers enjoying the novelty. The beer selection is broad, rather than excellent, which leads on to the bar's achilles heel - high pricing. Even a modest option like a bottle of Tuborg classic weighs in nearly double the price of nearby bars, and that continues across the board. As a cover charge to what is - almost - a sort of museum, there is an argument this is justified, but I would prefer to pay an upfront fee and enjoy fair prices than be squeezed in this way. It leaves an unnecessarily sour taste to what is otherwise a joyous experience. (Added December 2024)",

An old-fashioned bodega with an attractive brown/green patina of wood fittings and upholstery, a sense of institution to it that is clear from the figures you'll see on entering.  Online reviews may seem mixed rather than universally complimentary but that is due to the smoking, hardly unusual here, and the love/hate nature of such places. If you enjoy an old pub and want to experience Danish culture, this is a prime central example of where to do it. One of the few venues this side of the Dronning bridge to retain entirely fair prices for its wares too. (Added November 2024)",

On arrival you are ushered to a false bookcase and asked to figure it out (it isn't difficult). Descend into a suitably shady basement lair with the bar by the steps and lounge rooms and niches either side. Everything is clandestine, intimate, and the bar is well staffed too. Sat at the bar, the rhythms, rituals and patter of the mixologists help keep the vibe dynamic and friendly, while the lounges are boudoir like and distinctive, without the venue feeling like it was pasted from a template. Their signature cocktails are inventive while you can freely order \"off menu\" if there's another cocktail you desire. Prices remain reasonable - these would easily command a higher price in a Western city - without being cheap. It is a bar where you will get out of it as much as you put in - the crowd was a predictable mixture of locals, visitors, and some characters splashing the cash. Such bars provide a city like Iasi with a sense of the cosmopolitan, while in return Iasi's provincial feel really adds to the atmosphere, making it less pretentious and more personal. I'm sure they would hate to be described as provincial but it just shows you there are more elements that make up a good bar than copying others and expecting the same result. An essential venue when visiting Iasi. (Added November 2024)",

Warm, cosy and friendly. In the daytime it perhaps errs a little more towards cafe and bar, but a wide cocktail menu, local craft beers and evening schedule shows it is versatile and adaptable.

Live music nights provide further points of difference, while the large tellies speak of the need to gather together a relatively diverse crowd, making it a fairly versatile venue too. The large mirrors give a sense of space that is disarming, but on an evening accentuate the opulent surroundings. Something about The State as a whole is intriguing - intimate and sensual in some ways yet also a pub operated at scale. (Added January 2025)",

A storied history tracing back to the old days of drovers and metres worth of snow, these days a conveyor belt of hikers and day-trippers serves the place. Although there are some of the trappings of its fame in the pub, not least in some quite generic signage and bits of the interior design, there is still a sprinkling of stardust about it. A true Inn in the sense you can stay in its rooms, which people do on the off-chance they too can have an anecdote about being snowed in. Hosting dark sky stargazing due to its distance from artificial light pollution, and a yearly calendar full of one-offs that add something extra special. A stone fireplace by the bar is always a prime spot to warm up and enjoy one or more of their 50+ single malt whiskies, while they have their own label beers contract brewed for them available on cask. Dinners are hearty pub grub - not cheap but decent and filling. Something of a pilgrimage spot, that most people in the North should pay a visit to once in their lives. (Added December 2024)",

However, the attention paid to the environment inside and the sense of welcome and comfort plays an equally important role. Candlelit tables, fireplace and carpet gives it a cosy feel, somewhere you'd want to stay for a long time (not easy on Sunday when it closes at 7pm). Pub games, occasional live music and events and patio in summer make this an all-rounder you can keep on coming back to any time of year. For us, it's central Shrewsbury's finest pub.

A fireplace in the centre of the room adds to the feeling of homely comfort. Bass on cask, and among the finest we've tasted in years, alongside regional classics like Three Tuns makes this a very appealing option. The only drawback on our view was staff who, while friendly, held world views veering towards cranky (government control, keep cash stuffed in mattresses etc), meaning you may have some conversational obstacles to navigate. You were warned. (Added February 2025)",

A head turning selection of whiskies is enough to make you second guess your selection. Adding much needed depth and variety, Bierhaus has become a firm fixture on Cork's circuit.

Their connection with Irish folk and the live music scene in the city has survived the sways of trends and fashion, remaining a firm fixture 7 nights a week. To visit on a busy music night is to experience a concentrated shot of culture, that comes as naturally to the musicians and loyal patrons as extending your arm, but will definitely make an impact as an outsider. It's important to also state that it's just as much a social meeting place, and outside of performances Sin é functions as a pub well, more than capable. Owned by the Rising Sons Brewery who have established the 'Cork Heritage Pubs' tour, you'll find some beers not normally seen on the taps at Irish pubs, with the usual classics too. The interior is a bunker decorated from head to toe in its decades of memories. Sitting down even on a quiet lunchtime is to become immersed in the pub and its role in the city, making it truly special. Sin é has two floors, and the first floor is quite different. Still characterful but lighter and almost like being in a different place. It had been used as a barbers. Fame and history mean this one has a bigger reputation and more sought after - something its pricing seems to have noted too. However, even in summer months that doesn't reach the level you generally find at Dublin's institutions. A bonafide classic. (Added February 2025)",

Opened in 1957 and still family-run today by Mary Dennehy and her sons, you'll find one of the few original Cork pubs here. The central location has endowed it with many stories over the years, for example the colourful life of local legend Katty Barry, who is immortalised in a frame by the bar, along with other similar eccentrics. With a simple frontage leading to a small traditional bar, whose layout would not be seen today. The expansion to the rear sees Dennehy's switch to a tasteful blend of old and new - exposed brick, warm lighting and chunky tables. As a pub that has gathered a personality and a reputation, the sense of identity is palpable as you walk in. A real mixture of people come through the door due to its central location which can lead to some interesting encounters for all involved. (Added February 2025)",

Nowadays, the setting for an alleyway pub, one of those that feels nicely tucked away. In the centre of everything yet pocketed neatly. If you were walking briskly and not minding where you were, you'd easily walk past. To catch people's eyes, a huge mural has been commissioned opposite the pub, with tables spilling onto the street giving it that vibrant look. Inside, it's a tarted up old institution, at once familiar and pubby feeling, while also glamourised and refubished to an extent. All looks traditional at the bar as you enter, save for some more modern beer options from Rising Sons brewery (this is another Cork Heritage Pubs trail venue), but as you look around, the lounge to the right appears more like a candlelit cocktail bar, while the Moroccan lanterns the other side of the partition are distinctly not part of your average Irish pub ensemble. It is in this middle ground between chintzy contemporary décor and traditional fittings that Mutton Lane wishes to reside. The central location gives daytime trade a gossipy feel, but the low lighting everywhere has a sense of escapism all of its own. This works best later on in the day as day slides into evening into late night. You'll need to pay a visit here while in Cork. (Added February 2025)",

The pub became infamous, though also beloved by its adherents, regularly making the list of best bars in Cork.

These days, the opening time here remains 7am. Morning drinking has taken on a lurid, almost taboo reputation in modern times, but the rhythms of a city have to include all who dwell within in it. The Welcome Inn are proud of their hours and are not shy of acknowledging that as a result, they host a few colourful characters. It would be a disservice to define the pub only around this aspect, but it's important to know of it before visiting. The Welcome Inn has a classic \"drop in\" feel. As soon as you walk through the doors you feel at the heart of everything. The fire is crackling, the telly is on, the regulars in front of you are quipping, and a host of customers are gathered, standing around the bar. As you look around, the sight of Cork's heritage is pinned to the walls of the bar. It's a vibrant sight and gladdens our hearts to see a true mixture of people from different ages and class enjoying the place. Live music performances are regularly hosted, a small corner seating area transformed into a stage. While this is the city centre, so don't expect miracles, there are some decent value drinks to be found here. Although the beer selection is familiar and firmly traditional, there are some decent whiskies to be spied., including some rarities and antiques, they say. Despite some exceptionally strong competition in the city, the Welcome Inn still qualifies as a true standout. Don't be shy on your visit, get involved and you'll find you get the most out of it.

It's important to not let all discussions of traditional pubs fall into the same bracket though, for this is not a traditional pub in the way Sin é is, or the way the Abbey is, or in the way the Hi-B is. Each of them have their own take on the notion. Different spaces and formats. The Castle Inn is super basic and simple, a drop in bar area to perch on a bench, sip your pint and shoot the breeze. They like to think of it as a country pub in the city. You can kind of see why. The owner's parents (and...employees?) Denis and Mary live above the bar, and are often seen working behind it. With open fires, a snug, sport on TV (But not ostentatiously), this is one pub perhaps above all else where you can really feel dialled in to the events of the city. They also appear to still sell snuff. That's the flavour of this place. An unmissable pub in Cork. (Added February 2025)",

Trebon is a sleepy place and finding even a semblance of nightlife some evenings can be difficult. If U Certa is closed, this is your next best bet in the centre.

Gloomy lo-res photos of a characterful, but forlorn looking dive could hardly be less representative of this cult classic, a late bar that cut its teeth in the 1990s. Here we were imagining arriving to find the remaining 70-something men marking time in a largely empty pub, but instead found a vibrant, young audience both inside and stood out on the street. A bar that actually has more in common with the likes of the antiquey bars in Kazimierz district in Kraków, minus the tourists. Enter a homely, well-worn in small pub decorated with retro domesticity and a few hints at the pubs name to go with it. Tablecloths and lamp lights add an interesting touch to a usually minimalist format which Czechs don't often deviate from, adding a distinctive identity, the sort which you could easily become loyal to. There's an erratic feeling that suggests each visit here may go slightly differently, but service was really friendly, as were the surroundings. To add to its oddball, misfit feel, lesser spotted mid-range lagers on tap including some for a price which is really, really good. Would you order the fried cheese here? Possibly risky, but worth a try.<br><br>As with most bars of its kind, there are idiosyncrasies - it doesn't always smell great around the bar area, for example, but in the lounge it's super atmospheric.<br><br>Even allowing the surprise and delight to subside, when reflecting on our experience with a rational distance, we're still sure this is one of the best drinking holes in Czechia.

Established in 1995, offering live concerts and opening late 7 nights a week means this is a venue most residents have been to at least once. Originating as an Irish pub, the theme is thankfully not taken over by that, but you will find the walls of their small inside saloon cluttered in fixed mirrors and posters. It would be best described as Irish-adjacent, and simply stems from the time when Czechia was seeking different reference points for bars. These days, a schedule of gigs keeps the bar busy, with spring and summer evenings its zenith as the atmosphere spills outside in its courtyard and from their stage area. In winter, a small stage in the corner, little more than a step has hosted many mini performances over the decades. As for drinks, the place offers a broad back bar reflecting its status as something beyond a typical central European pub, while on tap, the predictable Pilsner Urquell and Guinness are supported by some budget options - on our visit Poutnik, but previously Hubertus. Prices are middling for the city centre, but not offensive considering the general offering. This is somewhere to visit with a few friends when the evening is bubbling up nicely in order to see at its best. (Added March 2025)",

Drinks are utilitarian, service is tolerant, and the atmosphere is one for those outsiders, misfits and unpretentious locals to turn up, have a chat, play a few games and forget about the sweeping homogenisation of Prague's pubs for an hour or two.

Nova Doba can be cliquey at the bar if some regulars are in, and you're best advised to stand your ground in that case, although service can be willing. Drinks are basic but cover bases.

A famous historic beer hall, unfortunately perhaps too famous for its own good. As a venue and an experience, worth maybe doing if you plan ahead and know the tricks. The venue is truly spectacular with 8 rooms decked out in dark wood, stained glass with frescoes on the wall, similar to a Bamberg style beer hall. They brew and their dark lager is undoubtedly one of the best in the country (or even best in the world). Since Covid they began doing a light lager, which was slightly disappointing given the unique quality of having only one dark beer. Visit on a Monday out of season (early March or something) earlier in the day and it can be quite a positive experience. However watch out for the raft of hidden extras they will add to your bill, and refuse the offer of Becherovka shots if you don't want an extra £5 to magically appear on your bill. Further marks down for the staff who patrol the place more like bouncers than servers, giving the feel of attending a beer hall in a police state, not quite allowing you to fully relax. The highs are so high it is worth trying, but you have been warned about the rest. (Added March 2025)",

As you enjoy a beer among the classical surroundings of wood panels, mirrors and beer ephemera, the calmness of the afternoon leaves absolutely no hint of the raucous nightlife to be found here, with singalongs and table dancing not only permitted but encouraged. For this reason it is destined to be a venue people have starkly different experiences of. Was this the ripoff place that was full of louts that gave bad service and wouldn't let you split the bill? Very possibly. Was this the lovely old cafe that served you a delicious beer with a smile for a fair price? Also equally likely.

The beers are a pleasing range of classic Austrian brewing and genuine specialist beers that would be difficult and in some cases impossible to find elsewhere in Linz, other than in boutiques. Prices are OK too considering the absence of competition. With a rock/punk soundtrack that isn't overly loud, it signals its identity reasonably well.

Taking over from a defunct operation in a prime location, the riverside setting proves an irresistible draw for people who want to enjoy a pristine pint of Pilsner Urquell with a pleasant view. That does take the focus of the pub. A large bar, styled with distinctive modern metalwork occupies so much space in the main room there is barely room for a stamgast table, and you'll be lucky to fit 8 people in there. But for a few leaning posts in the entrance, the second room to the right comprises the rest of the indoor seating. High demand and small space means you may be disappointed if you're hoping to turn up without a reservation, but the best days to try, ironically, are the busiest, because most will be outside rather than inside. A casual and disarmingly friendly approach from staff (we all remember what Czech service can be like) is a really distinguishing feature, making a first time visitor feel part of their scene. It is worth emphasising the beer here is served in super condition, which also helps. Formerly popular with visitors to the nearby theatre for a pre-post theatre drink, the swell of demand has meant that you could easily imagine copy and pasting the same pub along the riverside 4 times and filling all 4 easily.

The tapster Roman Pavlik belongs among the pantheon of famous old dudes working the beer taps around Prague. It isn't solely a seedy drinking den, as the pub welcomes respectful tourists and workers from the nearby Pasaz shops, cafés and theatres too. The entrance leads direct to the taps with a small bench to the left occupied by the regulars, with the benches to your right the safest bet. A 1990s refit has slightly, but not overly tackified the interior, indeed the surroundings themselves are taking on a certain age by this point.

Well, you'll be looking at a handful maximum that can compete with it in the city centre.

Tastefully curated with a mixture of retro artwork and brand signs, and as you survey the scene, you're still wondering what exactly is this. A late bar, a local pub, a cocktail lounge, a road house? The answer is, a little bit of all of that. One thing this is not, is a Gaststatte, or any kind of food-led Wirtshaus. This is where to go for an evening drink. The service at the bar has that sort of cocktail bar pretense, with the staff very much masters of the back bar, however, the approach and atmosphere is more casual still. Behind the bar they offer a few good beers as well as the wide selection of drinks. Huppendorfer Vollbier tastes as good on tap here as virtually anywhere. With darts and table football, this is an impressively versatile venue that due to its location pulls in a diverse audience, all without losing any identity or distinctive touches. It is, in essence, a superb creation. Forget how far out it looks on a map - hop on a bus and go to Nuremberg's finest bar. (Added May 2025)",

It's always exciting to find a small, independent alternative, especially a passion project. Zoigl is perhaps one of the more unlikely. Zoigl refers to a culture which exists solely in the Oberpfalz region in the far North East of Bavaria where ancient brewing rights bestowed on houses entitle families to brew and sell beer. This is done rotationally and the pubs are open once a month, creating a fantastic atmosphere and and enthusiasm. Simple kellerbier is served alongside basic snacks and a limited menu of warm food. Gernot Wildung has taken inspiration and exported the format, beer and culture to the Allgau! You'll find a beautiful pub with living room type style and a small bar. There's a quaint but very homely atmosphere as the locals adopt and adapt to this new format. A beautiful amber kellerbier with a depth and bitter finish is one you can put back several of in the company of people from the local town. While the conversation isn't quite as mixed as true Zoigl, they have done their best to encourage it. With only a few operations like this on Earth, there is a lightning in a bottle sense of specialness to visiting that elevates it beyond the typical German Wirtshaus or Gaststatte experience. If you announce your arrival and perhaps stay for a few beers and food, Gernot is more than happy to show you his brewery over the road, where upstairs an additional pub room exists with a view of the market place. This was open before Covid but Gernot seems less willing these days to open it up. <br><br>Clearly essential when visiting Kaufbeuren but if you have a Deutschland ticket this is worth a trip from Munich to visit.<br><br>(Added May 2025) <br>",

Don't think they are slouches when it comes to the quality of drinks either. Galerie am Stephansberg has as a regular beer a kellerbier served on gravity from the wooden barrel from Brauerei Sauer. Offering a younger crowd (in Bamberg this means under 50), and a kind of relaxed, bohemian informal take on a traditional pub. This is not a pub where you have to worry about being seated at a table or obliged to order food. It's more a place where you grab a board game or ask for a go on the piano. It's also a place you'll find locals. The famous beer halls tend to attract day trippers but with a lower profile, this bar is happy doing business with Bamberg's residents and anyone intrepid enough to find it - you can now add yourself to that list.

At the pub the Lagerbier is served 'ungespundet' on gravity from the barrel. A selection of typical fruit schnapps available too.<br>Style/Décor: ❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>A simple layout in the bar room, traditionally furnished in a compact social space, the design standout an overhanging lamp over the bar which is absolutely typical for the region.<br>Atmosphere/Character: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>A brewpub with a social focus, here is where to have an evening with friends rather than a meal out, a distinction which is very significant in a region where the idea of pub and restaurant is a grey area at best. Forget a Wirtshaus, forget even a Gaststatte, this is a pub to hang out and have fun in.<br>Amenities/Events: ❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>Food, snacks, outdoor seating, cards, seasonal events, stork nest (webcam on website)<br>Value For Money: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>Excellent value for money for both food and drink, deliberately offering simple food at fair prices, and beer at rates locals can afford.<br>description: A c.1808 brewery with a sky-high reputation among Franconians and Franconian beer adherents, this operation has remained within the same family since World War II. The Zehendner family don't outsource their work - on busy evenings in the pub you can bump into several family members, whether it's Grandma in the kitchen or master brewer Stefan himself greeting locals and visitors.<br><br>With a dedicated bus line from Bamberg passing by, getting here is relatively simple and doesn't take overly long either. Though that is the simple part.<br><br>Returning becomes more complicated as you sink into the wonderful surroundings and atmosphere of the pub, beer, food and environment gathering harmoniously and as it occurs to you that no, you don't want leave on the next -and only- bus home at around 6pm.<br><br>After this, it's a case of asking around to see if anyone would fancy sharing costs of a taxi. Not impossible given the visitors it receives from the city.<br><br>Their pub is a traditional Franconian taproom with the iconic long hanging lamp over the bar (think of the sort you get in old snooker clubs) displaying their brand; behind it, a barrel dispensing their Lagerbier on gravity, and warm, non-intrusive lighting that produces a glow - not unlike the one you will feel when you step out of the place. The layout of the pub interior is simple and unflashy, perhaps a little twee/quaint in the way rural Bavarian pubs can be, but nothing in your face.<br><br>As a venue, the taproom plays a role in the appeal of the venue in the way many great pubs achieve without quite being able to place your finger on it - a harmony of place and purpose. <br><br>Regulars sit adjacent to the taps playing cards or dice and chatting at their Stammtisch. Other locals occupy their time-worn spots. But you will find larger tables so don't be shy if it is busy, it is customary in the region to share tables communally, so you only need to ask.<br><br>Homemade pretzels and locally sourced ingredients for their simple food elevate the gastronomic experience, but it is important to emphasis this is a pub where the food plays second fiddle to the social element and to be honest, the beer.<br><br>Ah yes, that beer. A wonderful lager awaits, simply named but beautifully created, but there's a local divide over whether the Lagerbier or their tap Export is better. You can easily tell who has chosen which by whether they have a stone mug or a glass in their hand. Both have their qualities, as does their regular Weizenbier, while seasonally specials like Maibock, Weizenbock are notable.<br><br>Although a relatively modest operation when you visit in person, this is a brewery with a decent distribution. As such, their bottles displaying the guilty drunk monk with halo above his head, which you may already be familiar with, can be found anywhere across Europe including some surprising places.<br><br>Stefan is an enjoyer of various beer styles and if the opportunity presents (and if he likes you), he may share something from his collection. <br><br>We haven't touched upon the biergarten, also perfectly pleasant, or the stork nest on the roof, which despite some years of absences usually hosts stork families.<br><br>While you may think twice glancing at a map, be assured that this place can be visited relatively easily by public transport, and, with a bit of patience and perseverance you will likely find a way back to Bamberg with someone to share the cost of a taxi with.<br><br>In the future, the family's legacy looks to be on more secure footing, while it is interesting to speculate whether it will experience more custom or remain a kind of holy grail for those who have been to the core Franconian venues in the cities, and are seeking something perhaps quintessential.<br><br>(Added May 2025)<br><br>",

Prices are also low reflecting the particularity of the Franconian economy versus elsewhere in the country.<br><br>If you are heading east into Franconian Switzerland area for hiking or for more breweries, Heiligenstadt forms an essential public transport stopoff, allowing you to access further breweries at Aufsess, Heckenhof, Hochstahl, Breitenlesau, Nankendorf and Waischenfeld all within a days hike. Heading here for lunch first to help soak up those beers will therefore always be a wide move. (Added May 2025)",

    "description": "EBG Rating:: 8.9<br>Choice/Quality of Drinks: ❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>The one and only beer. Christened \"good Heckel vollbier\", brewed once a month. Full bodied with an immediate hoppy presence which subsides to a beer that shows considerable depth and body, potentially dangerous stuff.<br>Style/Décor: ❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>A plain, almost stark frontage halfway along a narrow lane near the fountain, with signage that looks like the many other closed breweries and operations from decades past. Only the clean lettering really indicates at a glance that this may still be an ongoing concern. Enter a small hallway with door advertising their peculiar opening hours, then the door into the promised land. This really is a tiny Gaststube with space for around 30 people comfortably, and maybe 40 at a push. Notice the crown glass on the doorway, such a typical feature of these lost in time central European pubs. Dark wood and a certain gloom until the light is switched on at a point of the owner's choosing. <br>Atmosphere/Character: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>One of the most concentrated, and at times intense exposures to local life you can find. This isn't only unusual for Germany but for the region too. A purely social focused brewery Gaststube which fills up quickly with locals. Your task is to find a seat and some method of communicating - if you have even basic German, brush up and try your best. The two brothers who have taken over the operation are polite, willing but naturally reserved characters. They show respect reciprocally so we would strongly advice to mind your p's and q's and you'll be absolutely fine. <br>Amenities/Events: ❤️❤️<br>Offsales, cutlery/placemats for any food brought in, limited outdoor space to drink by the fountain.<br>Value For Money: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<br>Put simply, a remarkable lager sold for possibly the lowest price in Germany.<br>description: Martin and Rainer Heckel took over their father's operation. \"Old Man Heckel\" and his one and only Vollbier had attained cult status in the region both for its quality and relative scarcity, but equally remarkable is their pub. <br><br>It is a Checklist of extremes and one offs.<br><br> Firstly, one of the smallest guestrooms in the country and opening hours that look like they were arranged by throwing some darts at times pinned to a dartboard. They don’t serve food of any kind here – extremely unusual for Franconia, although do allow you to bring food in to eat, even providing cutlery to do so. Then there’s the pricing – could this be the cheapest half litre beer in Germany? Zoigl in Oberpfalz used to be around the same price but has since risen, making this the strongest contender. Then there’s the beer. One beer, nothing else.<br><br>All of this has created a degree of mystique around the pub, certainly one we felt when originally hearing about it.<br><br> Walking towards Waischenfeld after a days hike across the region was a genuinely suspenseful moment.<br><br> Would it be as good as we hoped? Would there even be room? Would our terrible German help navigate the etiquette and conversation? Would it even be open? Brauerei Heckel’s remote location and combination of the above created a sense that this was our white whale.<br><br>We have now visited the pub.<br><br>Heckel fulfils nearly all expectations, being as quirky and intense an experience as anticipated, while also being richly enjoyable.<br><br>The pub isn’t one for shrinking violets, you are sat cheek by jowl to locals – nothing hostile but certainly intimidating for an outside. Unless you time your visit right, expect the pub to be packed out with only a few seats available. <br>The pub room is a 70s relic with crown glass patterned windows, dark wood and a sense of unlit gloom, almost as if it refuses to even doff its cap to the pretty riverside town outside it.<br><br>Card games are noisily played, laughter and banter flies across the room, and glass after glass of Heckel beer is consumed. At such a low price, why not? The beer provides an initial crisp hoppy bite, whacking you in the mouth, before that blends with a robust, full bodied sweetness. At 5.5% its dangerous stuff and before long you can get lost counting how far along you are.<br><br>The best moments are cultural exchanges, and so if you’re chatting to locals or visitors, a strange experience is one everyone can bond over, and this is truly a strange experience.<br><br>What makes it all the more interesting is that Martin and Rainer are reserved characters, rather than the life and soul of the party. They are respectful and give to the community and to outsiders. It’s important to acknowledge their work as part of visiting the place and to give them the kudos they deserve.<br><br>On almost every aspect this qualifies as a love or hate pub, but there’s so much to enjoy for those who really want to dig in to it. When we assessed it we considered whether we’d be happy coming here for the rest of our lives. It was easy: absolutely yes. (Added May 2025)<br>",

Leups is a village without much else to mark it as a destination than the brewery. They are used to daytrippers, less so foreigners. Local life and rhythms can be witnessed here, the ritual of greeting every table with a rap of the knuckles, the card and dice games, small details like placing the krug on its side when you've finished and wish to pay.

You can eat and drink happily here at a fair price. <br>description: Family owned since 1683, here is another beloved rural Brauereigaststätte in Franconian with a longevity that is startling. How they've managed to surf the waves of centuries past let alone the turbulence of a present day is an tale perhaps only the owners can tell. What we can tell you is that Leups, where they are based is an unassuming village of well kept houses and gardens, rather than some unholy Medieval backwater. It isn't the easiest place to access.<br><br> Other than a handful of buses from Pegnitz, Creussen and Bayreuth, it makes sense to have it as a target on a hike. Indeed, the Bierquellen is a marked trail if you wish to follow it.<br><br>We walked there from Pottenstein, a straightforward but enjoyable ramble through lanes and the heart of the Franconian countryside. Reaching the high point, a motorway, the terrain falls away towards Leups and its streams working their way to the valley bottom. <br><br>Gradl's taproom is no doubt a regional classic, complete with some of the iconic features - a branded hanging lamp above the taps, crown glass (usually dating a pub fit to the 1970s) and a Gaststube that is compact and social. <br><br>When guests arrive they take care to greet everyone and rap on the table - this is important etiquette and will help ingratiate yourself a little more. <br><br>Although we can't speak for morning service, on Wednesdays when they open at 3pm, the pub was full by 3.45. <br><br>It won't be easy if you don't speak German. With some shonky GCSE German we just about managed some basic polite conversation with locals, but if you have less than that, you may find it difficult. That said, there is usually someone in the room who speaks a little English.<br><br>Food is not expected here by any stretch, so if you wish to settle back for some beers you're more than welcome.<br><br>The beers? Well, Leupser Dunkel is renowned as a classc. Much drier, malty and herbal, it is one for the purists. Their pale lager isn't in the same league but still has a distinctive character that marks it out. The Dunkel is served on gravity from a wooden barrel, adding a further roundedness you won't experience drinking it from the bottle.<br><br>These are both available at an excellent price, as is their food. Not Heckel or Zoigl level, but pretty close. <br><br>If you've made it this far, then you are deep, deep into Franconian pub and beer culture experiencing the rhythms and etiquette of locals, content to be seen by regulars as the curious interloper. This is not the time to be shy. Get stuck in and enjoy what is a rich experience. (Added May 2025)<br>",

Morning opening hours 4 days a week also increase the chances of a successful visit. <br><br>Boasting to be Bayreuth's oldest brewpub, the name connects the venue to Bayreuth's brewing history. This was a city where every citizen had the rights to brew at a communal brewery, and so their historical records are connected with this. Baking and the use of yeast naturally incentivised many bakers to become brewers. They report the explosion of bakers running inns was particularly common from the end of the First World War, though in Becher's case, their history traces back to the 1750s. <br><br>Today, when you approach you'll find an unwieldy looking pub frontage with the brewkit shoved into view in a conservatory extension at the front, which gives absolutely no hint of the traditional time capsule 1970s pub room inside.<br><br>Their basic Krausen bier is lively, zesty but rich too, and a nice baseline flagship product. They do iterations of several styles, with seasonal rotations.<br><br>The atmosphere in the pub is very clearly not a city centre pub, but a locals one. Few visitors make the effort to take the pleasant walk along the Mistel stream to the outside of Bayreuth (unusually here, the Altstadt is a suburb rather than a city centre), but now you can be one of them.<br><br>(Added May 2025)<br><br><br><br>",

Originally innkeepers and bakers, leftover yeast was soon put to use in brewing. This began a storied history as a Bayreuth institution. These days, no longer in the family, or with independent brewed beer, a visit here may give cause to stop. However, the beers now brewed under a contract with only the label remaining have been kept reasonably faithful to their recipes, while the true reason to visit remains a pub which offers a genuine link to the past, a place which has absolutely not been sterilised into a tourist trap, or even a polite posh restaurant.<br><br>Instead, Manns is a regional classic, with an old-timer interior and many historic fittings to enjoy. Ownership and brewing may have passed on but the pub itself survives and thrives. Instead of walking through the door to find isolated families and diners, you'll find a Gaststube with regulars exchanging conversation, socialising and playing games over a beer or two. It's a magnificent sight and one you only wish was more widespread. Schafkopf, the famous card game is such a staple here even the website makes a point of mentioning it.<br><br>The staff at Manns has an international flavour, hardly surprising given it is a studenty town with a reasonable ethnic minority too. This gives a cosmopolitan flavour to what would otherwise be a quite parochial spot, and that's all to the better.<br><br>As it's Bayreuth, don't expect the same pricing as rural Franconia or the Zoigl area, with costs closer to the average German pub for food and drink.<br><br>If you're in the area it is a must visit.

The familiar drab cast of drinks, Sky Sports hoardings and a stench of death about the place that gathers when operations are desperately trying to cut costs was clearly not enticing. <br><br>However, spin on to 2025, the owners of Empire Café in the city centre have given the place not just a spruce up but a faithful reworking to a traditional city tavern of the likes you could expect in London, or - given its name - Edinburgh.<br><br>A wedge-shaped building, now dwarfed by the high-rise around it is obscured from view, situated down a slope and round a corner. They have revived retro 1960s signage for their branding, which seems more than a little like trying to hitch a ride onto the likes of The Lauriston in Glasgow, the real deal.<br><br>The tiled floor inside remains, and a red gloss ceiling with framed heritage artwork and breweriana from its Tetley's days work brilliantly.<br><br>Beer has been given a significant upgrade with cask and keg and ales along with good quality lagers.<br><br>The atmosphere since opening has been buzzing and vibrant, deservedly too.<br><br>Perhaps the only misstep is the food where over the top pricing and pocket sized portions to boot doesn't quite fit with the easy informality of the pub they've created. A slight adjustment price wise, even at a slight downgrade of quality will bring it into line with the likes of Whitelocks in the city centre. <br><br>Other than that, it's a welcome addition to Leeds pub roster and much needed. Additionally, it joins up a pub crawl from Kirkstall to Burley:<br><br>Kirkstall Bridge, Cardigan Arms, Daves Pies & Ales, Kirkstall Brewery Taproom and now the Highland Laddie.<br><br>Now you know where it is, what's stopping you?<br><br>(Added May 2025)<br>",

High ceilings, dark brown wood, modern but with a traditional touch. A bright bar area, tall tropical plants by the windows and interest geometric patterned floor (mind the steps in the toilet).

The owners of Pivo & Syn have chosen this spot to continue Brno's almost obsessive project trying to reboot the Czech hospoda. U Blahovky has become such an iconic spot that there is no shortage of attempts to bottle that magic and create it elsewhere. U Kuby offers a lot of the same aspects - a social focus with a stripped down menu, a few hot dishes, food to enjoy with beer, and a streamlined selection of beers from Kamenice and Prazdroj. The corner space with its high windows lets a lot of light in, while decoration has a retro patina in its art work and choice of tall tropical plants add to that too. Service is pleasant and the drinks are poured immaculately, although sometimes a little short measured. <br><br>Being around the back of the cathedral, what tourism Brno gets is unlikely to walk past this place naturally, meaning this is a spot for residents of Brno, both Czech and foreign. <br><br>As of 2025 this place represents a touchstone for the direction Brno pubs have been heading in the last 7-8 years.<br><br>(Added May 2025)",
