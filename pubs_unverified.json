The light above the door, with the Amstel beer logo and the word lampie (small light), gives away that this is not just a regular house. Since the 1920′s, this place has been the local pub for people in the neighbourhood. In those years, it was the place for rough sailors and labourers who liked to drink and sometimes even got paid in the pub. Those times are long gone, but some of those customers are still there. It makes Bierhuis Lampie one of those local pubs that you just have to visit once. You can find it just outside the canals that surround the inner city.

Beyond Bakter, exiting the train station building, among the three-story apartment buildings, a small block with painted walls immediately calls out for attention, and how well it does, because it is also a pub, and a very cozy one at that, where Borsodi on tap is the hit today, despite the close days. , from which it is worth asking - at other times and for others - with pikolo. On the tiny terrace, we ourselves become the characters of the wall painting. Eternal companions here are the five hard-working men standing by the butt-high slatted fence with beer mugs, plus the four sitting on the terrace roof who seem to be eternal and never stop discussing the affairs of the world. However, if they were to cross the threshold beyond the circle of beer lamps of Velkopopvicky Panama, they would see the visceral pub romance, the small press tables in the room paneled from the roof to the stone floor, the smiling old posters on the walls such as \"Every house should have Diana salted wine\" and \"Drown the beer in beer Your Sprite!\", and of course the bartender herself, the woman, the host, who seems interested in the stories of travelers like us. Ferenc Czinki mentions it in his book of mini-short stories: A Pub City: \"In order to understand Panama and the Railway Region, we must first understand the 1950s.\" Then he adds: \"The Panama mystery is only further complicated by the small addition that the students of the nearby high school, the people of Vasváris, called the three pubs, Hungária, Gomba, and of course the pub tour that includes Panama, not without good reason triangle.\" Let's say I would be much more interested in why Panama itself was named that way? I didn't get an answer to that. But if I start from the fact that the term \"Panamaization\" dates back to 1893, when the financial abuses surrounding the construction of the Panama Canal turned into a political scandal and was born in connection with the related lawsuit, as a synonym for corruption and fraud, it suggests something , which I don't see, but if this is true, this place will never disappear from the big Hungarian pub map.
